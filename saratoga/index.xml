      <description>Design system explainer   Coming up with a design system We adopted the atomic design methodology to ensure consistency between our products, make communication better, and to make development of our designs easier. In doing so, we created a system of elements that can be used together to build our pages. We started from the ground up, and were very careful to design each layer adhering to all previous choices.</description>

      <description> Buttons are designed to be placed in a center-aligned row using browser defaults and to have different levels of impact. There are three different types of button, but they all use the same base code.
EXAMPLE Impact button Regular button Ghost button  CSS button, .button { font: 600 14px &amp;quot;McClatchy Sans&amp;quot;; padding: .6em 1em .3em; border: 1px solid #4a4a4a; border-radius: 2px; text-transform: uppercase; cursor: pointer; } .ghost { border: none; }  RULES    Property Value     Typeface McClatchy Sans   Weight 600   Size 14px   Border 1 pixel solid #989898 with a 2-pixel radius   Case Uppercase    </description>

      <description> The card molecule extends the paper base molecule and adds Flexbox. By doing so the size of the card is stretched to match adjacent cards in each row. Card molecules should be the direct children of any Flexbox or Grid container.

      <description>The card-info molecule is the backbone of the design system. Spacing for most molecules and organisms is based on these default rules. This molecule only provides spacing rules.
Example    FOOD Hatch chiles bring heat and hearty flavor to New Mexican cuisine  March 16, 2018 11:33 am    CSS .card-info { padding: 15px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex: 1; } .card-info &amp;gt; * { margin: 10px 0 0 0; } .</description>

      <description>All captions have the same style. The figcaption is used as a semantic wrapper and to keep the cascade as configurable as possible.

      <description>The &amp;lt;figure&amp;gt; atom is used as a semantic method of targeting media in different scenarios. The default margins are removed and any images are contained to the container. In previous versions we used object-fit: cover to ensure a 16:9 ratio but that has been removed in favor of consistent images coming from the server.

      <description>Default browser spacing for the &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; atom should be used unless specifically set at the molecule or organism level. Doing so reduces bloat, given that this atom is used in many scenarios, and allows for cascading to apply properly at that level.

      <guid>https://mcclatchy.github.io/design/saratoga/impact/</guid>
      <description>The impact molecule simply reverses the color scheme of any element, and has a couple of additional rules to deal with card and label descendants.

      <guid>https://mcclatchy.github.io/design/saratoga/label/</guid>
      <description>The label should be used at the top of cards and headline stacks when necessary. There are two options: the default has relative spacing and pushes content down, and the .sticky class will make it lay on top of the lead art for the stack.
The label atom is just used for spacing and can accept any element. Currently, we only use the h5 atom on the site but that could change.</description>

      <guid>https://mcclatchy.github.io/design/saratoga/more-link/</guid>
      <description>The more-link atom signifies that clicking it will take the reader to another web page. It is only used at the bottom of digests and isn&amp;rsquo;t a headline, so typography and spacing is built in.
Example OPINION  Kudlow joins White House that sorely needs cooler heads to prevail March 19, 2018 5:34 pm   The Episcopal Church changed course for our LGBT members March 16, 2018 3:42 pm  The Kansas Republican Party is taking a stance on transgender identity March 16, 2018 3:58 pm  Letters: Readers discuss teen drinking, tax-cut benefits in Missouri and student protests March 16, 2018 4:08 pm   MORE OPINION   CSS .</description>

      <guid>https://mcclatchy.github.io/design/saratoga/p/</guid>
      <description>The default values for &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; are designed for the normal body text of the story page in order to keep our primary CSS as small as possible.
EXAMPLE Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praesent ut arcu consequat, pretium libero non, consectetur risus. Aenean sed turpis ac sem iaculis egestas sit.
 CSS p { font: 17px/1.5em &amp;quot;Lyon&amp;quot;, serif; }  RULES    Property Value     Typeface Lyon   Weight 400   Size 17px   Line Height 1.</description>

      <guid>https://mcclatchy.github.io/design/saratoga/paper/</guid>
      <description>The paper and card molecules both do the same thing of lifting them a plane higher than the background. The paper molecule is the more simple of the two, by having block for the display property. This allows default sizing and spacing of the children to dictate the height of the molecule.
In our digests, the design dictates that there be 15px of space between the label and the first headline, then 30px of space between each additional headline.</description>

      <guid>https://mcclatchy.github.io/design/saratoga/summary/</guid>
      <description>The .summary atom is an alternate use of the &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; element when presenting articles in cards or headline stacks.
Example Perhaps no one can speak to the legacy of former Kansas State football coach Bill Snyder like former K-State president Jon Wefald, who presided over his hiring and offered his perspective to The Star.
 CSS .summary { font: 400 14px/1.5em &amp;quot;McClatchy Sans&amp;quot;; }  RULES    Property Value     Typeface McClatchy Sans   Weight 400   Size 14px   Line height 1.</description>

      <guid>https://mcclatchy.github.io/design/saratoga/time/</guid>
      <description> Timestamps are always displayed on their own line, so &amp;lt;time&amp;gt; is converted to a block level element by default.
EXAMPLE DECEMBER 27, 2018 01:27 PM  CSS time { display: block; font: 300 11px/1.5em &amp;quot;McClatchy Sans&amp;quot;, sans-serif; text-transform: uppercase; color: #989898; }  RULES    Property Value     Typeface McClatchy Sans   Weight 300   Size 11px   Line height 1.5em   Case Uppercase   Letter spacing Default   Color #989898    </description>
