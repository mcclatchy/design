      <description>Design system explainer   Coming up with a design system We adopted the atomic design methodology to ensure consistency between our products, make communication better, and to make development of our designs easier. In doing so, we created a system of elements that can be used together to build our pages. We started from the ground up, and were very careful to design each layer adhering to all previous choices.</description>

      <description>The author card should appear directly underneath the related stories organism, if it is rendered, or directly under the story body if it is not.
As the organism compresses to fit smaller screens, the icons should wrap under the author&amp;rsquo;s name and still right of the thumbnail. The biography uses the summary molecule and shoudn&amp;rsquo;t deviate from the defaults. Also, the author&amp;rsquo;s name should be made a link and shown in the standard byline style.</description>

      <description>Buttons are designed to be placed in a center-aligned row using browser defaults and to have different levels of impact. There are three different types of button, but they all use the same base code.
EXAMPLE Impact button Ghost button Text button  HTML &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;button class=&amp;#34;impact&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Impact button&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt; &amp;lt;button class=&amp;#34;ghost&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Ghost button&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt; &amp;lt;button&amp;gt;Text button&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; CSS button, .button { display: inline-block; font: 600 14px &amp;#34;McClatchy Sans&amp;#34;; padding: .6em 1em .3em; border: 1px solid transparent; border-radius: 2px; text-transform: uppercase; cursor: pointer; } .</description>

      <guid>https://mcclatchy.github.io/design/saratoga/byline/</guid>
      <description>The byline and credit rules should have this standard anywhere attribution applies. This includes articles and all media. The byline should display inline with a caption, when applicable, unless there is not enough room to display the byline in full. If that occurs the whole byline should wrap to a new line.

      <description>The card molecule extends the paper base molecule and adds Flexbox. By doing so the size of the card is stretched to match adjacent cards in each row. Card molecules should be the direct children of any Flexbox or Grid container.

      <description>The digest is simple stack of modules using the block layout.

      <guid>https://mcclatchy.github.io/design/saratoga/expander/</guid>
      <description>The expander is a simple molecule to toggle the visibility of it&amp;rsquo;s siblings. The element itself acts as the toggle by swapping the open class. This can be done a number of ways, but to keep things simple for the demo we used the onclick attribute directly.
The generic rules make for a very flexible setup, where we can force each child to display in all cases inline or with additional CSS in the future.</description>

      <guid>https://mcclatchy.github.io/design/saratoga/figcaption/</guid>
      <description>All captions have the same style. The figcaption is used as a semantic wrapper and to keep the cascade as configurable as possible.
example  On May 10, 1987, 13-year-old Roy Collins was shot while jumping fences in a Kansas City neighborhood. We recreate the shooting according to police and witness reports. By Neil Nakahodo The Kansas City Star     CSS figcaption, .caption { font: 14px/1.5em &amp;#34;McClatchy Sans&amp;#34;, sans-serif; color: #707070; padding: 10px 0 0; } RULES    Property Value     Typeface McClatchy Sans   Weight 400   Size 14px   Line height 1.</description>

      <guid>https://mcclatchy.github.io/design/saratoga/figure/</guid>
      <description>The &amp;lt;figure&amp;gt; atom is used as a semantic method of targeting media in different scenarios. The default margins are removed and any images are contained to the container. In previous versions we used object-fit: cover to ensure a 16:9 ratio but that has been removed in favor of consistent images coming from the server.

      <guid>https://mcclatchy.github.io/design/saratoga/grid/</guid>
      <description>This is the smallest method of creating a grid following the design rules, which state that grid elements should be no smaller than 300px and have 30px of space between each item. It is very likely that at the template level more sophisticated grids will be required to fit everything onto the page dynamically.
Note: We have not decided yet if the CSS Grid has enough browser support for full use.</description>

      <description>Default browser spacing for the &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; atom should be used unless specifically set at the molecule or organism level. Doing so reduces bloat, given that this atom is used in many scenarios, and allows for cascading to apply properly at that level.

      <description>The impact molecule simply reverses the color scheme of any element, and has a couple of additional rules to deal with card and label descendants.
Example OPINION  Kudlow joins White House that sorely needs cooler heads to prevail March 19, 2018 5:34 pm  The Episcopal Church changed course for our LGBT members March 16, 2018 3:42 pm  The Kansas Republican Party is taking a stance on transgender identity March 16, 2018 3:58 pm  Letters: Readers discuss teen drinking, tax-cut benefits in Missouri and student protests March 16, 2018 4:08 pm   MORE OPINION     FOOD Hatch chiles bring heat and hearty flavor to New Mexican cuisine  March 16, 2018 11:33 am     HTML &amp;lt;article class=&amp;#34;card impact&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;figure&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://mcclatchy.</description>

      <guid>https://mcclatchy.github.io/design/saratoga/inline-cta/</guid>
      <description>The inline CTA should be used in the story body. Under the dynamic content rules, it will be moved on the page and the wording will change. To allow for maximum flexibility, it&amp;rsquo;s a standard stack of atoms and follows the same rules as all other ads on the page.
EXAMPLE Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praesent facilisis ex ex, at blandit sapien suscipit eget. Maecenas gravida, erat vitae commodo semper, lorem sem molestie metus, quis faucibus tellus.</description>

      <guid>https://mcclatchy.github.io/design/saratoga/label/</guid>
      <description>The label should be used at the top of cards and headline stacks when necessary. There are two options: the default has relative spacing and pushes content down, and the .sticky class will make it lay on top of the lead art for the stack.
The label atom is just used for spacing and can accept any element. Currently, we only use the h5 atom on the site but that could change.</description>

      <description>List items should be indented an additional 15px left from the normal text, and have 10 px of space between them. Unordered lists should use the circle icon from fontawesome.com in order to increase the bullet size.
EXAMPLE Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec viverra venenatis leo ut tempus. Quisque auctor posuere placerat. Integer pulvinar convallis massa ac ultrices. Fusce sit amet aliquet dolor. Aenean fermentum euismod ultrices.</description>

      <guid>https://mcclatchy.github.io/design/saratoga/more-link/</guid>
      <description>The more-link atom signifies that clicking it will take the reader to another web page. It is only used at the bottom of digests and isn&amp;rsquo;t a headline, so typography and spacing is built in.

      <description>The package molecule is the backbone of the design system. Spacing for most molecules and organisms is based on these default rules. This molecule only provides spacing rules.

      <description>The paper and card molecules both do the same thing of lifting them a plane higher than the background. The paper molecule is the more simple of the two, by having block for the display property. This allows default sizing and spacing of the children to dictate the height of the molecule.
In our digests, the design dictates that there be 15px of space between the label and the first headline, then 30px of space between each additional headline.</description>

      <description>This organism is mostly a combination of the grid and package molecules, with a single override for package molecules inside the element. The organism should appear directly under the story body when stories are added to the related bucket in CUE.

      <description>The series nav is a visual tool to link stories together than may or may not be part of the same section or publication. The code is just an expander molecule with a little additional styling for the text.
Example MORE FROM THIS SERIES  Series headline goes here Nullam ultricies hendrerit est a bibendum. Suspendisse scelerisque vitae nisi et consequat. Vivamus cursus vitae ante eu tristique. Sed nec velit maximus diam laoreet venenatis.</description>

      <description>The primary challenge with the story body is the design rule that media should bleed all the way to the edge of the screen on mobile and tablet devices, but be restricted to a maximum width as the screen gets larger. Additionally, different media or embeddable content will have different widths.
A container-based approach to these rules requires multiple breakpoints and creates a couple of pressure points as the number of organisms increases.</description>

      <description>The .summary atom is an alternate use of the &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; element when presenting articles in cards or headline stacks.
Example Perhaps no one can speak to the legacy of former Kansas State football coach Bill Snyder like former K-State president Jon Wefald, who presided over his hiring and offered his perspective to The Star.
 CSS .summary { font: 400 14px/1.5em &amp;#34;McClatchy Sans&amp;#34;; } RULES    Property Value     Typeface McClatchy Sans   Weight 400   Size 14px   Line height 1.</description>

      <description> Timestamps are always displayed on their own line, so &amp;lt;time&amp;gt; is converted to a block level element by default.

      <description>The timeline organism is a stack of events styled for chronological display. In the live updates implementation, all events should be shown at all times. When using the timeline as a story telling enhancement to a normal story, it should be combined with an expander molecule to hide what&amp;rsquo;s not completely necessary to the story on initial load. This will change from story to story.
Example Before the case went cold A look at the murder of 18-year-old David Krulewicz and the rape of his 15-year-old girlfriend Susan Weed — and the years&#39; long investigation before the case went cold in 1983.</description>
