    <h2>JESSICA GILBERT</h2>

    <p>My role is to advocate for the importance of design in strategic decision making and to clear paths for the design team to build beautiful, meaningful and intentional products. I’m known for my dislike of notched objects in type, lazy carousels, italicized articles in headlines and useless decoration. You can often hear me uttering the words, “Who is this for” or “It looks tacked on” or “Am I reaching for the stars here?”</p>

    <p>I lead a talented group of PMs, researchers, and designers dedicated to building products that meet our readers’ needs. My day-to-day includes project management, analyzing data, setting KPIs for new features, conducting user research, and product roadmap wrangling. I love answering three questions: “Should we do this?” “How should we do this?” and “Should we keep doing this?” Outside of work, I love painting, throwing dinner parties, kickboxing and (admiring) great furniture design.</p>

    <p>I obsess over our audience funnel, from how to attract diverse groups of audiences to how to show the value of our journalism so that they subscribe and keep subscribing. I approach audience development through a product strategy lens, focusing on personalized user journeys that meet specific audience needs while building our subscription business at the same time. Outside of work, I’m a busy mom to two little humans and a dog and love living in North Carolina.</p>

In my spare time, I root for the Kansas City Chiefs, Kansas City Royals and Liverpool FC; and I make it my mission to find and consume all the good craft beer I can.</p>
