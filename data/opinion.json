      "content": "\u003cp\u003eThe encampment on 28th and C in Downtown Sacramento was no different than other homeless encampments throughout California: Around 30 people, most living in tents, having been on the streets for months or years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery day for nearly three months, local outreach teams helped get people off the street. At a city council meeting, I asked: How many were enrolled in comprehensive, “wraparound” mental health and substance abuse treatment services? The stunning answer: Only one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut why hasn’t the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), the millionaire’s tax initiative I led in 2004, done more to alleviate the homeless crisis for the thousands of people with serious mental illness and substance abuse living on our streets? The answer: very little MHSA money is focused on chronic homelessness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo be clear, the MHSA’s billions have helped tens of thousands of people get the care they need. And, until recently, it was essentially the primary source for addressing the needs of people without insurance or access to mental health care.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:201347249% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, nearly 20 years later, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Senator Susan Talamantes Eggman are seeking to modernize the MHSA. \u003ca href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB326\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eSenate Bill 326\u003c/a\u003e, if approved by the voters next March, would give the Legislature greater flexibility in dispersing MHSA funds. Newsom and Egman propose a more aligned approach for counties to spend dollars on proven responses to data-driven needs while retaining local flexibility to meet local needs. Larger percentages of funding will be allocated to housing for people living with serious mental illness or substance abuse and wraparound services, with a specific focus on the chronically homeless and a continuing focus on community care, including prevention and early intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile there has been wide support across the state, from mental health advocates and first-responders to local leaders like me, a few changes have drawn a predictable response from some county leaders who suggest that if they’re required to spend more MHSA dollars on chronic homelessness, valuable programs must be cut. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCurrently, California’s 58 counties invest billions of dollars in community-based care with virtually zero state guidance. For the first time, a California governor is proposing that the state has both the right and the obligation to set priorities that address the most serious crisis of our time. Newsom is creating accountability to deliver results and establishing ongoing funding for statewide housing and workforce to ensure our state has the mental health care beds and health care workers it needs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe governor’s call to prioritize the chronically homeless mirrors the original intent of the act.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2004, we wrote Proposition 63 to build on a successful pilot program I authored to begin fulfilling then-Governor Ronald Reagan and the legislature’s unkept promise when they shut state hospitals. Their well-intended policy promised to shift 90% of the savings from hospital closures to community-based mental health care, but that never came to fruition. The idea, the language and the campaign for the MHSA in 2004 emphasized addressing the most tragic consequence of that failed promise: the growing numbers of chronically homeless people living with serious mental illness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNearly two decades later, homelessness remains a top priority for most Californians, as recent studies show the money being spent is not focused enough on addressing this crisis. Newsom’s proposal would bring about much-needed accountability at the local level so Californians can finally see results.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eApproximately 82% of unsheltered Californians live with a serious mental health condition, according to UCSF. Current MHSA rules require the majority of direct service funds be directed toward the ‘whatever it takes’ approach, but MHSA’s oversight and accountability commission reported that nine out of 10 counties with the highest homeless population are failing to meet this requirement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOrange County, the only county meeting the required standard, saw a 17% drop in people experiencing homelessness from 2019 to 2022 — even while the statewide homelessness rate went up. That success is not a coincidence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for concerns about cutting prevention programs, it’s important to note that the modernization of the MHSA is not occurring in a funding vacuum. Over the past decade, state and federal funding for behavioral health has more than doubled. \u003ca href=\"https://steinberginstitute.org/the-steinberg-institute-releases-new-analysis-of-governor-gavin-newsoms-behavioral-health-proposal-finds-governors-plan-makes-urgent-and-necessary-changes-to-the-mhsa/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA recent report provides a detailed look at these funding increases\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUntil now, California has never had a governor who made behavioral health a real priority. Newsom and the Legislature have invested billions of dollars in a complete overhaul of our statewide behavioral health network. Combining these new investments with a more focused and accountable MHSA is the best chance we have to make good on one of California’s longest unfulfilled promises. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"ng_endnote_contact\"\u003eDarrell Steinberg is the current Mayor of Sacramento, former president of the California State Senate and led the Proposition 63 initiative in 2004.\u003c/div\u003e",

      "content": "\u003cp\u003eA spectacularly unfortunate chapter for the Sacramento City Council does not end because the city is paying a $26 million settlement to developer Paul Petrovich, who soundly beat the city in court for its handling of his Curtis Park development project. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe headache only continues due to the city’s decision to buy from Petrovich a near-empty office building on one of the most distressed blocks on K Street in downtown Sacramento.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:201347249% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe city confirmed that it had to dig into its own coffers to make Petrovich whole. Insurance money is not covering the purchase of the Hale’s Building at 831 K Street (site of the former Rite Aid store) from a Petrovich firm for $18.5 million. That is roughly the same amount that the city spends from its general fund on directly homeless services in a year. This is a big deal; it is the city’s living legacy of council meetings that courts found had acted in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article277858738.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003ebiased manner\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe settlement also includes $7.5 million in direct settlement payments. The sources of funds, according to the settlement, will include “the city and by one or more of the defendants’ insurers.” According to city spokesman Tim Swanson, the city will entirely fund the purchase of the office building at 831 K Street from the general fund and a “risk fund” that is used to pay liabilities not covered by insurance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow great a time is it for the city to get into the office business on this block of K Street? Consider that just a few steps away, the 28-story Renaissance Tower at 801 K Street is approximately\u003ca href=\"https://www.commercialcafe.com/commercial-property/us/ca/sacramento/renaissance-tower-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003e two-thirds empty\u003c/a\u003e, based on lease availability.

It has also apologized in writing to Petrovich “for conducting an unfair hearing.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll this money and angst was over a proposed gas station. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePetrovich’s proposal to build a gas station as part of his Crocker Village retail complex took on a larger-than-life quality to the neighborhood. The opposition in the neighborhood saw it as creating pollution and traffic. Petrovich saw it as an important amenity for the complex. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeading the charge against the gas station on behalf of the neighborhood was its representative on the city council, Jay Schenirer. He has been a true public servant for years in Sacramento on the council and the board of the Sacramento City Unified Schools District. But he went too far. In one ruling\u003ca href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/business/article241860466.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003e Sacramento Superior Court Judge Michael Kenny\u003c/a\u003e wrote that Schenirer “demonstrated “an unacceptable probability of actual bias.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen a council doesn’t give an applicant a fair hearing, it has crossed a legal line into trouble. As an appellate panel wrote, “Councilmember Schenirer acted as advocate, not a neutral and impartial decision maker, and should have recused himself from voting on the appeal.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSchenirer served on the council from 2010 to 2022 and was a signatory to the settlement. He did not apologize.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is a broader lesson to be learned here. It is for city council members to recuse themselves when they have become so biased as to be unable to be fair. Or a city attorney can advise that the council member step down from voting out of the same concern because voting could expose the city to legal liability. Neither happened. And now Sacramento will pay dearly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat is the city’s plan for its office “investment” at 831 K Street? To convert the building into some other use other than an empty building, where is the money going to come? The drain on city funds could only be beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePetrovich has been among that rare breed of developers who has shunned the relative simplicity of suburban development for the grit of urban redevelopment, in this case converting the once-polluted Curtis Park rail yard into a modern urban neighborhood. The political environment surrounding the redevelopment project ended up creating its own kind of toxic environment. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt took no less than three lawsuits and untold massive legal bills (the city spent more than $2 million on lawyers) for Petrovich to finally get justice. The city fought and fought until it simply ran out of options. The city council and Mayor Darrell Steinberg, in directing this litigation through decisions in closed sessions, behaved like gamblers. They doubled down after losing one ruling after another until their pockets were empty of legal theories. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey gambled with our money. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWho knows how often local governments act so unfairly that it is downright illegal. It takes a very deep pocket and years of patience to prove it. Paul Petrovich did it. Hopefully the Curtis Park gas station fiasco does not haunt 831 K like a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:239341538% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

How many times have you heard some variation of “only two hours from the Bay, and two hours from the mountains”? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSacramento has been fighting and losing that battle for decades, and I think it’s time to stop. No one wants a glossy, $6,000 boat ride down our river. We want to see Sacramento celebrated for what it has to offer now, in 2023 — and that’s much more than you might think. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSacramento seen her way\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsider the (often-unpaid) work of Maddy Eccles, a 34-year-old, Sacramento-based social media influencer whose videos on Instagram and TikTok highlighting the city are all anyone in my social circles seem to be talking about. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe’s far from the only influencer Sac can boast of, but Eccles seems to have hit local consciousness in a new way lately, and several of her videos have gone viral with more than a million views. She uses her platform to reach an audience of 25- to 45-year-olds who see Sacramento not as a jumping off point to other locations, but as a city to be proud of in its own right. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEccles’ recent videos feature businesses like \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CvisbopLISd/\"\u003eMidtown Spirits’ boozy slushies\u003c/a\u003e for hot summer days; local sights like the the \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CuZ3JTjOoKm/\"\u003e“purple palace”\u003c/a\u003e on P Street; regular events like First Fridays on R Street or Second Saturdays in Midtown; the Citizen Hotel for \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cucv_RLx1kr/\"\u003ea treat-yourself staycation\u003c/a\u003e; and even a \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Ct2Ni5gvnzA/\"\u003eshockingly great wine selection\u003c/a\u003e at an ampm in Elk Grove.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Ctfz6VtvYby/\"\u003ealso blends\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CtjjoKixMGP/?img_index=1\"\u003e local humor\u003c/a\u003e into her videos, like when she touched on the special brand of torture that is the downtown freeway interchange, or talked about how the city’s heat index could rival Satan’s sweaty armpit in the summertime. Her comment sections are filled with people who say they’re grateful for her videos and had no idea there were so many fun things going on in our area. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s an underrated city,” Eccles told me. “People have lived their whole lives here, and they grew up thinking Sacramento was a cow town and there’s nothing to do, but now there’s so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEccles, a San Diegan by birth who moved to Sacramento from Texas nearly five years ago, created the \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/beginnersguidetosac/\"\u003e#BeginnersGuideToSac\u003c/a\u003e on her blog, but says her posts on social media didn’t really take off until the pandemic when people were looking for ways to get out of their house. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, she focuses more on video content, has more than 100,000 followers across multiple platforms, was recently hired as an independent contractor with Visit California and is trying to make a full-time career out of promoting Sacramento.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Sacramento is very possessive about their community,” she said. “I think that it’s a big town that feels like a small town. I can walk down the street and run into people I know, but I can also easily talk to business owners and chefs.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eA different side of the city\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSacramento often gets a bad rap for being “boring,” but Eccles uses her pages to showcase a different side of the city, one that’s bursting with events and businesses catering to a younger demographic. It’s hardly curated and only barely edited, Eccles told me, but her Millennial and Gen Z audience prefers that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I just want to be as authentic as possible,” Eccles said. “I think that content that looks too much like an ad is a turn off. It’s more entertaining and easier to watch when it’s a real person, not a paid actor.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo when you see the news that this city can’t hold onto a luxury river cruise, stop and consider the facts: That exorbitantly priced voyage was never about highlighting what Sacramento has to offer, it was an East Coast-based company appealing to wealthy consumers that have too much cash to burn.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYoung Sacramentans aren’t impressed by costly, luxury experiences or the city’s proximity to “better” locations. We have less money than ever in our pockets and we want to love the city we live in. We’ve spent too much of our youth cooped up inside and we’re ready to bust out; meet us on our level and we’ll show Sac the love. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(And hey, if you want a riverboat ride, you can get one for \u003ca href=\"https://www.cityexperiences.com/sacramento/city-cruises/private-events/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwldKmBhCCARIsAP-0rfxmZCVEev12hpY-42Via7WlwZoTSdmul1OftMBqKeKF2Uk-SArUMocaAqRKEALw_wcB\"\u003e$30 with a full bar\u003c/a\u003e.

      "content": "\u003cp\u003eIn 1998, then-Gov. Pete Wilson signed a bill requiring that every child born in the state be evaluated for hearing loss. No governor since then, including Gavin Newsom, has been willing to go the next step and require insurers to cover the only available cure: a set of hearing aids. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNewsom may soon get a second chance. A bill mandating insurance coverage is sailing through the Legislature with unanimous support. One big reason for the support is the general understanding among legislators that a state-run program initiated by the Newsom administration to provide these life-changing devices does not appear to be working effectively. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSigning virtually the same bill that he could have four years ago would be an admission by the governor that he had made a mistake. But such an admission would be the human ⁠— and humane ⁠— thing to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:201347249% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf he doesn’t cut his political losses, Newsom faces a small army of impacted parents who aren’t going away. And California would remain one of only 18 states that consider a child’s hearing loss as purely optional for insurance to cover. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“This has been a battle that has played out over many years,” said Nick Janes, a 37-year-old Rocklin resident whose six-year-old son, Jake, has faced severe hearing loss since birth. “To us, it is inconceivable that this wouldn’t be a covered benefit.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJanes’ wife, Christina, has seared into her memory the moment when a hospital physician described how her newborn son would grow up with a bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, which renders any hushed sound inaudible. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Twice as likely suicide, half as likely for college,” remembers Christina Janes, a former evening anchor at Sacramento’s CBS affiliate, KOVR, where she worked for nine years. Nick Janes worked at the station as well as a reporter. “That’s what the doctors told you,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Janes have the financial means to afford hearing aids for their son. Jake is “doing great” and starting first grade this month, Christina said. But as the couple has become part of a tight-knit community of parents with the same challenge, they hear of others facing tough financial choices between paying the bills or letting their child hear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278146677; alt=\"undefined\"% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“In our clinic, we see hard-working families who simply cannot afford hearing aids for their child, and we see the speech and language delays that happen when children who need hearing aids can’t get them,” states Dr. Dylan Chan, director of the Children’s Communication Center at the University of California, San Francisco. “These preventable consequences are not only devastating for the child and family; they are costly to society. Without timely intervention, one child born deaf or hard-of-hearing costs taxpayers up to one million dollars in special education and loss of productivity.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIronically decades have passed and Sacramento hasn’t mandated hearing aids for children precisely because of the costs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB598\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eAssembly Bill 598\u003c/a\u003e in 2019, a twin of the current effort, was opposed by the California Association of Health Plans out of concern that premiums would go up.

Two other attempts never made it out of the committee process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut with parents like the Janes packing committee rooms, AB 598 made it out of the Legislature without a single no vote. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278146672; alt=\"undefined\"% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the bill never made it to the governor. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBloom and Allen killed their own creation; they let AB 598 \u003ca href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billHistoryClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB598\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003e“die”\u003c/a\u003e (the proper legislative term) by withdrawing the bill from the fact-checking process known as “engrossing,” the final step before legislation is “enrolled” and sent to a governor. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy?

Rather than insurers paying for the hearing aids from patient premiums, taxpayers would through a new state program he would advance in the following year’s budget. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrue to his word, next year the state Department of Health Care Services would establish the new \u003ca href=\"https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/HACCP/Pages/Home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eHearing Aid Coverage for Children Program\u003c/a\u003e (HACCP).

In California, a lot of the medical sector simply avoids dealing with the bureaucracy of state-run programs, a decades-long reality that goes way beyond the issue of hearing aids for children.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There weren’t many providers that wanted to take it because of the historically low reimbursement rates and the red tape,” Marciniak said. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to the California Department of Health Care Services, HAACP has received 458 applications from July 1, 2021, through August 2, 2023 and has enrolled a total of 255 children into the program. Advocates estimate this is about 7 percent of the eligible population.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“As with any new program launch, engagement and onboarding processes for both providers and targeted populations tend to be slow with ramp up until familiarity is gained with the program on all fronts,” said health department spokesman Anthony Cava. The department “acknowledges the challenges HACCP faced in the first year of its implementation and understands there are ongoing concerns from the consumer advocate community on program enrollment and provider access.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo the program’s credit, its online applications portal has options for at least 19 different languages. This may not be for a lack of government trying. It may be that a government-run approach is simply less effective than telling the private insurance sector to cover the device.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAllen voted for SB 635 earlier this year (under new authorship, Caroline Menjivar, D-Van Nuys and Anthony Portantino, D-Burbank) along with all 39 other senators. “Apparently (the Hearing Aid Coverage for Children Program) has been underutilized,” he said. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe health insurance industry is no longer opposed to the legislation. Instead, it is officially “concerned” about the same cost issue. At the moment, no organization opposes the bill.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSB 635’s last real hurdle is in the cost committee, Assembly Appropriations. Its chair is Chris Holden, D-Pasadena, and he voted for AB 598 back in 2019. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWill the bill reach Newsom? And what would he do? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I have developed some skepticism over the years,” said Marciniak. And for good reason.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis would be a revealing moment for the governor. He could sign the legislation and admit that his government-run alternative proved to be both more expensive and less effective than private-sector insurance coverage. Or he could rehash the same cost rationale, kill SB 635 just like its predecessors and hope that his state-run program reaches more children. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, every day a child can’t hear is precious developmental time that is lost. \u003c/p\u003e",

Steinberg has sought a collaborative approach among their respective staffs to prioritize city actions leading to a greater district attorney caseload that hopefully leads to greater use of services such as addiction treatment. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHo, meanwhile, has launched an investigation that may target unnamed city officials. And, on Monday, he responded to Steinberg’s olive branch with a club.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt a press conference Tuesday morning, Steinberg detailed how he had privately made Ho a very provocative offer. The mayor said he would support something that “I am not comfortable with,” which is citing homeless residents en masse for misdemeanor crimes. In turn, however, Ho would have to adopt a prosecution strategy for these cases that prioritizes “the care they deserve,” namely diversion into substance abuse and mental health services.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHo so far has refused such a partnership. Instead on Monday, he basically offered nothing new from his office while asking the impossible of city hall. He wants shelters with 24-hour security for thousands of homeless (75% of the estimated outdoor population) established in 30 days. He wants four new city attorneys hired in 30 days to prosecute more code infractions, and he wants the 16 identified major encampments eliminated. All in 30 days.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGovernment cannot get through the advertising process for a new hire in 30 days, much less interview and hire new staff members. New ordinances take considerable time to craft and enact. Ho has been in government long enough to know this, yet demands it from Sacramento anyways. He appears to be playing to a different audience than the social service workers, law enforcement officers and non-profit organizations that confront this crisis each and every day. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/article278028868.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eErwin Chemerinsky\u003c/a\u003e, dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law, argues that Ho’s threat of prosecution is based on a misreading of a court decision that essentially prevents cities from criminalizing homelessness.

That’s why Sacramento County District Attorney \u003ca href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/article277472633.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eThien Ho is plainly wrong\u003c/a\u003e in his threat to investigate city officials for failing to enforce state public nuisance laws and allowing homeless encampments within the city limits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNo one disputes that homelessness is a serious problem in every major city in California. There are many causes of the problem, but especially a statewide shortage of affordable housing. No easy solutions exist, and every city is struggling with finding ways of providing shelter for their unhoused.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:201347249% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat is clear is that cities cannot make it a crime or a public nuisance for people to be homeless when there is not adequate shelter space. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn \u003ca href=\"https://homelesslaw.org/supreme-court-martin-v-boise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eMartin v. City of Boise\u003c/a\u003e, in 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Eighth Amendment, which outlaws cruel and unusual punishment, “prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties for sitting, sleeping or lying outside on public property for homeless individuals who cannot obtain shelter.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust last month, the Ninth Circuit reaffirmed this in \u003ca href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/20-35752/20-35752-2023-07-05.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eJohnson v. City of Grants Pass\u003c/a\u003e. The court declared an Oregon city’s ordinance was unconstitutional when it stated that “no person may sleep on public sidewalks, streets or alleyways at any time as a matter of individual and public safety.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe city’s ordinance also precluded homeless persons from using a blanket, a pillow or a cardboard box for protection from the elements while sleeping within the city’s limits. The Ninth Circuit also declared this unconstitutional because the government cannot punish people — criminally or civilly — for being unhoused.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese decisions are correct; every human being must sleep. It is cruel and unusual punishment to punish people for conduct where they have no alternative. If there are not adequate shelter beds — which there aren’t in California — then people have no choice but to sleep on public sidewalks and in parks, and they need blankets and cardboard for warmth. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven this context, District Attorney Ho’s threats against Sacramento city officials are unfounded and misguided. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a letter to members of the Sacramento City Council, Ho rightly declared that “(b)eing unhoused is not a crime and we should not seek to criminalize homelessness.” But then he makes clear that is exactly what he wants to do. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“However, my office has a duty to prosecute offenses in violation of California’s criminal statutes,” he wrote. “In fact, the Sacramento District Attorney’s Office has entire units dedicated to prosecuting misdemeanor and felony cases. The responsibility to enforce and prosecute Sacramento City Ordinances and Code violations rests squarely upon the City of Sacramento and the City Attorney’s Office.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHo goes even further in his suggestion that he is investigating Sacramento city officials for their failure to take action against the unhoused. The DA is seriously overstepping his authority here. His role is to prosecute crimes; it is just wrong to suggest that city officials might have committed a crime by not enforcing laws, let alone criminal laws that they cannot constitutionally enforce against the unhoused.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSacramento City Attorney Susana Alcala Wood has publicly responded to Ho and pointed out that his letter misinterprets federal court decisions and that he wrongly asserts that California law imposes on government agencies “an affirmative obligation to eliminate public nuisances on their property.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe solution to the problem of homelessness is not going to emerge from this unnecessary dispute among government officials or from actions of the DA’s office. Being homeless cannot be made a crime or a public nuisance. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe answer, as difficult as it is to find, must come through building more shelters and providing more services.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is possible that the dispute between the DA and the city attorney could go to court if Ho decides to initiate an action against city officials. Such a suit would be frivolous and likely to be quickly thrown out of court. If Ho decides to initiate prosecutions against the unhoused, these will fail based on the Ninth Circuit’s decisions. Indeed, there almost certainly would be a suit in federal court to enjoin Ho, which will make it back to the court of appeals in a year or two.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat will provide the Ninth Circuit with another chance to reaffirm a basic principle of law and human decency: The government cannot make it a crime for a person to sleep in public if there is nowhere else for them to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"ng_endnote_contact\"\u003eErwin Chemerinsky is the dean and a professor at the UC Berkeley School of Law. \u003c/div\u003e",

      "content": "\u003cp\u003eTo some residents of Sacramento, Cesar Chavez Plaza is an eyesore, with anywhere from 20 to 30 or more unhoused individuals set up in tents, sprawled out in the sun or gathered in small groups around the fountain. But for the folks who spend their days or nights here, this park is their home. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s a home with no air conditioning, water or fans. And in the summertime, when Sacramento sees triple-digit temperatures, no one feels the impact of the heat more than the city’s unhoused residents. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the summer of 2021, the weather was relentless. I called up two friends and told them my plan. They brought the coolers, I bought the water and together we drove to Cesar Chavez Plaza.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe hadn’t been out of the car two minutes before Oliver, who calls Cesar Chavez Plaza his home, appeared next to us. After drinking an entire water bottle in one single gulp, Oliver asked if he could help us distribute waters around the park.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfterwards, we got to chatting, and I came to find out how Oliver had ended up here. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:201347249% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDecades ago, Oliver suffered a brain injury in a work accident. He asked my friends and I how old we were, and when we told him we were in our early 20s. He said that, at our age, he thought he was going to rule the world. He had his whole life ahead of him, a good job, good money and plenty of people around. After his injury, though, things stopped going his way. He could no longer work, he lost a few good friends and then, when the last people in his life who cared enough to take care of him died, he no longer had a home. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“You’re so much closer to this than you’d ever believe,” Oliver warned me. “Just a couple bad days and you’re standing right where I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I asked Oliver about the change in heat over the last few decades, he told me there was nothing like the heat of recent years. While heat waves are nothing new in Sacramento, in the last few years, they’ve gotten much worse. In fact, according to \u003ca href=\"https://climateassessment.ca.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eCalifornia’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment\u003c/a\u003e, average global temperatures are expected to increase \u003ca href=\"https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2019-11/20180827_Summary_Brochure_ADA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eby at least 2.7 degrees by the year 2039\u003c/a\u003e. Heat waves are also expected to have higher daytime and nighttime temperatures, last much longer and spread much farther. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile 2039 may seem like a long way away, no one knows better than the residents of Cesar Chavez Plaza that you don’t have to wait a couple decades to feel that summers have gotten hotter. One woman I talked to in the park said “there is no escape” from the heat. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We have nothing that helps and things have gotten much worse,” she told me. “It’s always too hot.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVulnerable populations, like migrant workers, individuals under the poverty line, the elderly and the unhoused, are most at risk for sickness or death in extreme weather conditions. As temperatures continue to rise, so does the death count. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \u003ca href=\"https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/Applications/heatTracker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003ean average of 702 heat-related deaths occur every year\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs extreme heat becomes a more frequent norm in Sacramento, it seems that resources and aid for those most in need are scarce. Cooling centers in Sacramento are available, but the unhoused residents of Cesar Chavez Plaza mentioned how difficult these shelters are to actually get to because of how far away they’re usually located. Some folks said that, when they do go to these shelters, they are not allowed to bring personal items, so many refuse to go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach time I was able to make a trip to Cesar Chavez Plaza that summer to distribute water, I wondered where the help was. If I wasn’t there to offer water, who was? Where was the city? Why is there not been a better policy to help our unhoused neighbors in Sacramento survive the heat? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the city’s unhoused residents, it’s not about being uncomfortable in the heat, it’s about surviving it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs my friends and I climbed into my car to leave Cesar Chavez Plaza for the last time that summer, I took a moment to look back at the park one last time. I watched as Oliver looked around aimlessly, appearing not to know what to do next or where to go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we drove away from the park, all I could think was: What do we do now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"ng_endnote_contact\"\u003eKatherine Hunter is a Sacramento native residing in New York City and pursuing a career in creative nonfiction.\u003c/div\u003e",

      "content": "\u003cp\u003eTransparency in government is generally considered a good thing. But there is a growing trend in California for governments to weaponize it, to release personal information for various agendas that at the moment are trending on both sides of the political spectrum. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReal sunshine can be harmful in large doses. So is government information that is used to scorch people on the wrong side of political leaders. Three recent examples:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Southern California’s Chino Valley Unified School District, its board voted 4-1 to notify parents if a student, filling out a form or talking to a teacher, wants to be known by “a name or pronoun other than those listed on the student’s birth certificate” or other records. In other words, if a kid is transgender, that is news to be spread to everybody.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:201347249% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTony Thurmond, the California State Superintendent of Public Instruction, recently spoke to the Chino board to oppose the parental notification policy and respect the privacy of its students.

Exposing someone who has put hundreds and hundreds of local residents behind bars was a reckless move that outraged the labor union representing the prosecutors. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe political backdrop for all of this and much more is a complicated and ongoing court conflict between Ford and Price, who also happens to be facing a bitter recall election. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, there is a recent incident right here in Sacramento. An information rights group asked Sheriff Jim Cooper to stop voluntarily sharing \u003ca href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article276848586.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003elicense plate information\u003c/a\u003e with other states, particularly those in states with abortion restrictions that could potentially use the information to track the private movements of patients.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a state assemblyman, Cooper had supported a bill that restricted such sharing of information. As sheriff, he apparently changed his mind. On Twitter, Cooper later said that the Electronic Frontier Foundation is “protecting child molesters, fentanyl traffickers, rapists and murderers.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat is a pretty curious criticism of \u003ca href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/lcwaN0004119/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003ean organization\u003c/a\u003e that has been around for 33 years and is active around the planet on various digital conflicts that can potentially compromise personal privacy. And it does not explain an apparent change of thinking in his conversion from a legislator back into a law enforcement officer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Constitution does not mention the word “privacy,” although it does promote some ways to protect it, particularly in the\u003ca href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003e Fourth Amendment’s\u003c/a\u003e prohibition against unreasonable searches and the \u003ca href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt14-S1-8-8-3/ALDE_00000832/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eFourteenth Amendment’s\u003c/a\u003e promotion of equal protection. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf any student in the Chino Valley Unified School District happens to publicly identify as transgender, it is hard to make the case that the district is protecting this student equally by its notification policy. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis school board provided the state schools superintendent only a minute to \u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1909R0JzgDZNs3EM6kNAfgoQmMhEnbrybK7seSrOiXKc/edit\"\u003espeak\u003c/a\u003e. Thurmond tried to make the most of it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We can debate all the laws and all of the policies and practices, I ask you to consider this,” he said. “That nearly half of all students who identify as LGBTQ-plus are considering suicide. I ask you to consider this. That the policy that you consider tonight might not only fall outside of the laws that respect privacy and safety for our students, but may put students at risk.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoard President \u003ca href=\"https://www.chino.k12.ca.us/Page/53706\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eSonja Shaw\u003c/a\u003e responded. “Here is the problem.

Some fared better than others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:201347249% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn this historic night, the outgoing mayor was no lame duck. This may have been the toughest majority Steinberg has ever had to muster in his seven years as mayor. But he did it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSteinberg offered scant details about this \u003ca href=\"https://homeless.cityofsacramento.org/SafeGround\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003e“Safe Ground”\u003c/a\u003e plan in the official proposal to establish these new city-sanctioned encampments. He offered no plan on how each site will be managed. He suggested no criteria for Chan to select the sites.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis was part of the sophisticated strategy behind what Steinberg sought to accomplish. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSacramento’s political history has shown that when council members get involved in trying to select new shelter sites or managed encampment sites, nothing happens. The unvarnished delegation of power to a manager who can get it done, combined with the public’s intensifying sense of urgency for the city to do something, were his two greatest arguments. And they prevailed. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“This is like a fire,” Steinberg said at the beginning of the meeting. “This is an emergency. Treat it like an emergency.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe mayor’s premise is that Sacramento is better off with city-designated encampment locations than the unmanaged, shifting chaos that too many neighborhoods face today. Safe Ground is a more stable landscape. It also dramatically improves the ability of social service providers to connect regularly with those in need, gain their trust and hopefully open the door to tailored social services. It is the option that can make a difference in a matter of months, not years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSacramento has lacked the political will to get this done before, so Steinberg and the council majority want Chan to get started immediately instead of letting the process get bogged down by conditions and calls to study the issue further. It’s not that we don’t favor transparency in government decisions, we do. But calls for transparency in the past became vehicles for obstructionism. In this case, the transparency will have to come as the process moves along because Sacramento can’t wait any longer. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach City Council member faced different repercussions from the mayor’s proposal. Chan’s plan, given the ambitious unofficial timetable, is to look at vacant city-owned land.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“They are vacant for a reason,” Chan told the council. “They are not located in our central district. I want to be clear about it. How do we implement this quickly?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Chan said there are hundreds of city-owned parcels throughout Sacramento, it was clear that some council members were acutely aware that the truly suitable parcels were in their districts, and they happened to vote accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The majority of it will land in District 2,” said Councilman \u003ca href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/article272662438.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eSean Loloee \u003c/a\u003eof North Sacramento. He voted no.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCouncilwoman Mai Vang of South Sacramento’s District 8 was “actually in agreement” with Loloee — a rare occurrence — for the same reason. She voted no. “Safe ground has to be distributed throughout the city.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSteinberg was conceptually supportive of distribution, but not enough to require that in delegating site selection to Chan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Why? It would slow progress down. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“If we are saying that the highest priority item of this council is to have these sites geographically dispersed, it will drive the timeline,” Chan said. “I promise you that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCouncilman \u003ca href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/marcos-breton/article10302575.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eEric Guerra\u003c/a\u003e, who represents District 6, voted yes, citing the mandate of November’s Measure O for the city to make progress. “District 6 doesn’t have any viable public land,” he added. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCouncil members Rick Jennings, Caity Maple and Katie Valenzuela gave Steinberg the slim majority he needed. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It is kind of amazing that we are here,” said Maple of District 5. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I think it is a great plan,” said Jennings of District 7.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Valenzuela, who represents District 4, the vote was a milestone in “how far we have come.” But she still had questions. She said she would love to know about “sites being considered. If we can see a list.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChan did not take the bait. “We are compiling some lists,” he said but offered no details.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was the complete loss of political control that seemed to lead to the two remaining no votes, Karina Talamantes of District 3 and Lisa Kaplan of District 1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The city elected us to be accountable,” said Kaplan, who challenged the mayor’s notion to look beyond the short-term cost of his proposal. “Money is an object. What about our city employees? We are in the middle of negotiating with all of our unions. Do we spend it all on the unhoused or look at what the city employees deserve?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring Talamantes’ exchange with the mayor, the meeting turned personal. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“People are going to be upset about the site locations we propose,” Talamantes said. Regardless, she wanted control. “We are a brand-new council,” she said. “Allow us to identify the sites ourselves. Talk to our neighbors. Don’t force this on us.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHistory is simply not on Talamantes’ side, as previous attempts to establish legalized encampments in the city died because objections such as hers prevailed. Meanwhile, a homeless problem became a homeless crisis in Sacramento. A slim majority of the council was not going to let this tough decision stall again, even if a majority of those voting yes may very well not have encampments in their districts. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn frustration, Talamantes turned on Steinberg. “The city has done no good neighborhood policies with my community. When was the last time, mayor, you went out to District 3?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe last time she invited him, the mayor replied in an exchange with interruptions. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe meeting proceeded. Guerra gave Steinberg his majority with some new conditions. He wanted Chan to design buffer zones and policies to inform and engage neighbors of Safe Ground encampments. He also wanted the county to follow through on its commitment to provide services for mental health and addiction treatment to the extent the city can enable it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the outcome clear, Kaplan in her closing returned to the mayor’s exchange with Talamantes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I was offended by how you were treating her,” Kaplan said. “We women need to stand up when we feel our opinion is not being valued and heard for what it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSteinberg stayed calm. He had lost two pounds of political flesh by then in the process, one from the personally critical question from Talamantes and then the critique from Kaplan. During a session when Steinberg valiantly tried to maintain chamber decorum, right down to silencing the phone line of “bigots” during public comment, the mayor would not be thrown off his game and incur a self-inflicted wound. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe was gracious.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn his signature calm voice, the mayor showed complete command of the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“If I interrupted you and was rude to you in any way, I apologize,” he said to Talamantes. “I do my very best to run this dais to respect everybody. I do. And I think, by and large, I think I do a pretty good job of it.

      "content": "\u003cp\u003eIt finally happened. The big one. The criminal indictment on Tuesday of former President Donald Trump on grounds he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe four-count, 45-page indictment came more than 2 1/2 years after Trump incited the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and, in the process, encouraged an attack on democracy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhether you dreaded this day as a terrible time for the country or cheered it as justice too long delayed, the now three-time-indicted former president will finally have to face accusations that he used his power as president to try to subvert the will of the voters and stay in office, even when it was clear he’d lost the election. The indictment charges him with three crimes: conspiring to defraud the United States, conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiring against people’s rights.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis extraordinary moment had to come. Trump must be held accountable for his actions — or lack of them, because he did nothing for hours to quell the deadly insurrection in his name. Otherwise, our system of laws will have no meaning. The fact that these charges have been lodged while Trump attempts to regain the same office he betrayed so completely is more proof of the existential danger he poses to our democracy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump issued a statement through his campaign calling the charges “fake” and saying he was being targeted by a “weaponized Department of Justice to interfere with the 2024 Presidential Election.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eA day of horror\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, there are Americans who continue to insist Trump did nothing wrong — and there are many of them, cult-like in their loyalty — but so many others in this country remember the horror of that day and know that something went not just wrong, but dangerously so. We remember the fear in our guts as armed crowds surged past the barricades and overran the brave Capitol police in Washington, D.C. We remember watching seething mobs storm into the building, hunting for members of Congress and for Vice President Mike Pence, threatening to hang him. That was no empty threat: They erected a gallows with a noose on the grounds of the Capitol.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe remember the shame of seeing the Capitol defiled that way, by our fellow citizens. We remember wondering where the National Guard was, knowing that Trump certainly could have called upon them to defend the beating heart of our democracy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump has been charged, but we, too, as a country, need to face these accusations. Looking the other way, as the Senate did when it refused to impeach Trump after the attack, has only deepened the wound to the nation and emboldened those who seek to undermine our government. Trump himself has become more intent, openly, on expanding his power. And he has spawned the likes of Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump’s actions are unprecedented. He already has been indicted twice before this. One case, in New York in March, accuses him of violating state law by falsifying business records related to alleged hush-money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 election. The other, based in Florida, accuses him of taking documents containing national-security secrets, keeping them at his Palm Beach estate, then attempting to obstruct justice in that investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e‘Destabilizing lies’\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd now there is this case, the one with the greatest ramifications for democracy because Trump’s actions tried to undermine trust in our elections. As the indictment says, “Each of these conspiracies — which built on the widespread mistrust the defendant was creating through pervasive and destabilizing lies about election fraud — targeted a bedrock function of the United States federal government: the nation’s process of collecting, counting and certifying the results of the presidential election.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor those who say Trump should face the consequences of his actions at the ballot box, yes, he should. Many prefer that to time-consuming legal proceedings. But casting a vote against Trump cannot be the only recourse we have if — as seems most certainly to be true — he broke the law in at least one of these cases and probably more. And that’s exactly what trials are for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRemember that \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/03/25/1165022885/1000-defendants-january-6-capitol-riot\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emore than 1,000 people\u003c/a\u003e have been charged in the Jan. 6 attack, a violent assault that cost five lives, defiled the Capitol and had members of Congress running for their lives. At least 89 of those defendants have come from Florida, where the ex-president lives. Among them was Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader who lived in Miami and was convicted in May of seditious conspiracy in the plot to attack the U.S. Capitol. Should we prosecute them but not the ex-president?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn some ways, certainly, this is yet another new low for the country, attributable to Trump. But it may also show us that our institutions are strong enough to stand up to the kind of prolonged assault that a person like Trump — an amoral person with money, power and a massive, easily wounded ego — has heaped on it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re about to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"mailto:heralded@miamiherald.com\" title=\"Click here to send letter to the editor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:277535953; alt=\"undefined\"% --\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"mailto:heralded@miamiherald.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eClick here \u003c/a\u003eto send the letter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:250064099% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

There are both engineering ways to capture and store industrial emissions and natural approaches to absorbing carbon emissions such as reforestation.
