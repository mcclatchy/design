The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global currencies, was up 0.23% to 103.401.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\"\u003eCME Group's FedWatch\u003c/a\u003e now indicates an 88.5% chance that the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting in September, with bets on a quarter point increase in November rising to around 35.4%. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"Participants noted the recent reduction in total and core inflation rates,\" the minutes indicated. \"However, they stressed that inflation remained unacceptably high and that further evidence would be required for them to be confident that inflation was clearly on a path toward the Committee’s 2%objective.\" \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolid retail sales for the month of July, which showed the key control group reading -- which feeds into GDP calculations -- surging 1% from the prior month, have added to hopes that consumers are weathering the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes while continuing to leverage the earnings power of an historically tight labor market. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe spending rush, however, has revived concerns that the Fed may need to lift rates once more between now and the end of the year in order to keep inflation from ticking higher over the autumn months. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurther signs of a recovery in the housing market added to that concern, with July housing starts rising by a faster-than-expected 3.9%, to an annualized rate of 1.452 million units, even as the Mortgage Bankers' Association said 30-year mortgage rates matched a 2001 high of 7.16% last week. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Get investment guidance from trusted portfolio managers without the management fees.

That's a significant problem as covid has stopped being an active concern and air travel has returned more or less to prepandemic levels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe lack of pilots, of course, is not the only problem limiting growth at the airlines. Boeing has fallen behind on its deliveries and the Federal Aviation Administration faces an acute shortage of air-traffic controllers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese problems have caused many airlines to cut routes and limit service in certain markets. Many of the above-mentioned airlines have cut as much as 10% of their flights from New York and Washington because the FAA allowed them to do so due to the shortage of air-traffic controllers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSouthwest, however, despite dealing with its own pilot and aircraft delivery issues, has continued to expand and has added a major new hub.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:271064037; alt=\"8abd892f-6bc6-4747-8bd1-1f36b0a1ab56\"% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSouthwest expanding in Nashville\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSouthwest has decided to build its 12th crew base at Nashville International Airport. The airline will open its new crew base with 150 to 250 pilots starting in early 2024 and will grow that to 500 to 600 pilots and 500 to 700 flight attendants going forward. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"Hundreds of Southwest employees who work in the air and on the ground already consider their hometown to be in middle Tennessee, with our presence in Nashville remaining a key factor to our success, future growth, and the reliability of our network,\" Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA crew base is a hub where crew members live and from where they can start their workdays. It's common in the airline industry for pilots and flight attendants to live in places other than their base cities. That adds a layer of potential problems as those staff members need to fly to get to their assignments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSouthwest has been flying out of Nashville since 1986 and it's now the largest carrier at the airport. Adding a crew base in the city is part of the airline's broad plan to avoid delays and eliminate systemwide failures like the holiday meltdown that left tens of thousands of passengers stranded last December.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://aap.thestreet.com/story/16130473/1/we-re-moving-this-bullpen-name-up-to-the-portfolio.html?placement=editorialMCD\"\u003eHere’s why we just bought shares in this fast-food chain!

And, I guess, hot employee market as well. You have to work extra to hire people and to keep people. And so, it's a record year from our pilot hiring,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat does not tell the full story as keeping pilots has been a challenge, but the problems have not hurt Southwest's plans so far.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"It's also a record year for pilot attrition, but it's a modest number that is not sufficient to actually change our plan. So, our amount of flying we have this year and the next is not at all affected by this, kind of, a little bit uptick in attrition this year,\" he added.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSouthwest is currently negotiating a new contract with its pilots union while other airlines have reached new deals.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"We do see pilots as a kind of a job hop around the industry, trying to maximize their personal gain, what airline appeals them the best. And I don't begrudge that to them because it's once you start with the main line, it becomes ... a lifelong commitment\" because of the seniority system, he said. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWatterson also says those issues might be settling down.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"We do see some people who come and leave right away, but it's -- I think it kind of spiked here in the second quarter and now it's kind of even starting to tail off a little bit,\" the COO added. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eGet exclusive access to portfolio managers and their proven investing strategies with \u003ca href=\"https://subscriptions.thestreet.com/real-money-pro?placement=editorialv1\"\u003eReal Money Pro\u003c/a\u003e.

Now, Royal Caribbean is making a similar commitment to Florida with its higher-end Celebrity brand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:270498257; alt=\"26b0e466-5c17-49b4-879f-0e45217b6035\"% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCelebrity cruise line brings more ships to Florida\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCelebrity has generally rotated one or more of its ships through Miami, Port Canaveral, and Fort Lauderdale (Port Everglades). Now, for the winter 2024-2025 season, the Royal Caribbean-owned brand intends to base four of its ships in Florida for an extended period. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo ships – Celebrity Apex and Summit – will sail out of Fort Lauderdale’s Port Everglades. From October 23, 2024, to March 8, 2025, Apex will sail 6-7-night itineraries making stops in destinations including St. Maarten, San Juan, Grand Cayman, and Mexico, as well as select sailings to \u003cem\u003ePerfect Day at CocoCay\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e Summit, the smaller and older of the two ships, will sail 5-9 night itineraries from February 25, 2025, to April 10, 2025 the Western and Eastern Caribbean.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCelebrity will also bring a ship to Port Canaveral for the first time as Celebrity Equinox will call the port home from November 21, 2024, to April 19, 2025. During this time, the ship will sail 20 new itineraries (most lasting 7 nights) with stops in Caribbean destinations including the Bahamas, Belize, Grand Cayman, Mexico, San Juan, and St. Maarten. Equinox will also have two March sailings, March 1 and March 15, 2025 that will visits Royal Caribbean Perfect Day at Coco Cay private island.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, while Royal Caribbean’s largest commitment has been to Florida’s east coast ports, it is not ignoring the west coast. The cruise line will bring more sailing on Celebrity Constellation to the port in Tampa Bay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The new program expands the brand’s offerings with four new itineraries and a total of 14 sailings for the season from January 2, 2025, to April 6, 2025. These itineraries will visit destinations like Belize, Honduras, Key West, Mexico, and New Orleans during Mardi Gras, scheduled for March 1, 2025,” the cruise line shared.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese changes essentially reposition some of Celebrity’s ships from sailing in Europe – including the Edge Class Apex – to Florida. The cruise line’s newest ship, Celebrity Ascent, will call Miami its home port when it begins sailing in December. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGet exclusive access to portfolio managers and their proven investing strategies with \u003ca href=\"https://subscriptions.thestreet.com/real-money-pro?placement=editorialv1\"\u003eReal Money Pro\u003c/a\u003e.
