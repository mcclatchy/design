      "content": "\u003cp\u003ePhiladelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw will step down this month to help lead a New York-area transit system, the mayor said Tuesday, ending a turbulent three years in which she guided one of the country’s largest police forces through pandemic lockdowns, Black Lives Matter protests and frequent turmoil over race and policing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOutlaw, the first Black woman to run the 6,000-member department, came aboard just before the pandemic shutdown and quickly had to oversee the city’s safety as intense protests broke out in Philadelphia and across the country in the summer of 2020 over the police killing of Black people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer resignation comes just a few months before the end of Mayor Jim Kenney’s tenure and as the rates of homicides and other crimes have become a major issue in the race to replace him. She will soon start a top security position with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTensions between Philadelphia police and the public escalated after George Floyd’s killing in May 2020, when mostly peaceful protesters who shut down a major city expressway were met with tear gas and rubber bullets. The city council issued a statement calling the police response “brutal,” “excessive” and “unacceptable,” but Outlaw initially defended the strategy. The city later paid a $9.25 million settlement to hundreds of protesters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater that year, police came under rebuke again when a young Black man named Walter Wallace Jr., who had a history of mental illness and was brandishing a knife outside his home, was shot and killed within seconds of police arriving to the scene. Outlaw bemoaned the lack of mental health services while pledging the department would do better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd they came to a head again just last month, when the department had to backtrack to say that a man who was killed by an officer who had stopped him for erratic driving had neither lunged at police with a knife nor exited the car, as police officials initially claimed. Outlaw moved to fire the officer for insubordination and other alleged policy violations in the Aug. 14 death of Eddie Irizarry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Commissioner Outlaw has worked relentlessly for three and a half years during an unprecedented era in our city and a number of crisis situations, and she deserves praise for her commitment to bring long-overdue reform to the Department after years of racism and gender discrimination prior to her appointment,” Kenney said in a statement. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe has named First Deputy John M. Stanford Jr. as interim police commissioner. While campaigning, Democratic mayoral candidate Cherelle Parker has skirted questions over her plans for leadership at the police department.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the last few years, Philadelphia has seen a sharp increase in homicides, setting a modern-day record in 2021 with 562 homicides that year. Homicides declined slightly in 2022 and advocates have said they are on track to decrease further this year. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut even though Philadelphia was hardly alone among U.S. cities in experiencing a rise in homicides over that time, it has had a hard time combatting a Republican narrative of being a Democratic city with a progressive district attorney that is overrun with violence and danger.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Outlaw faced a gender bias lawsuit from within the department that yielded a $1 million federal verdict to two female officers who said they endured a hostile work environment that included being put in undesirable jobs after they lodged sexual harassment complaints.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOutlaw came to Philadelphia from Portland, Oregon, where her handling of protests had also raised concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the port authority, Outlaw will be the deputy chief security officer. The agency also announced the creation of a new security and technology department that will oversee safety at facilities throughout the agency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe scrutiny on police funding, tactics and practices in the wake of George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police officers contributed to more than half of the leaders in the Major Cities Chiefs Association — a group comprised of the heads of the 79 largest departments in the U.S. and Canada — to retire, resign or otherwise leave their posts in 2020 and 2021, including those in Dallas, Miami, Detroit and Boston.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“While there will be many Monday morning quarterbacks second guessing her performance and decision-making, I have nothing but a great deal of respect and admiration for the job that she has done for our city,” Parker, the presumptive favorite in the mayor’s race, said in a statement.\u003c/p\u003e",

If a person lives in the same public housing complex as accused gang members, the NYPD may say they frequent a ‘known criminal group location’ (strike one) while wearing gang colors (strike two), which is enough for officers to add them to the database,” the report notes. “(The) NYPD can also add individuals to the database based on two ‘independent reliable sources,’ but officers decide who’s independent and reliable, and no one checks their judgment.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat the police call the Criminal Group Database contained about 16,000 names as of April. That’s down from about 34,000 names in 2014, when the NYPD said it began reviewing each entry to see if they warranted inclusion, NYPD officials said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the NYPD Inspector General called for better safeguards and fleshed out criteria on how names are added to the list the STOP report determined that “even the most rigorous safeguards would be insufficient to mitigate the full range of harms that these databases pose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“They must be eliminated in their entirety,” the report notes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eElani Manis, research director for STOP said the report shows how “it is alarmingly easy to be added to a police database based on nonsense, non-criminal criteria, and difficult or impossible to be taken off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The result is bloated databases that produce no known public safety benefit—nothing at all to outweigh the grievous harm they do to young people who are added to databases without any evidence,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn Friday, the NAACP filed a new lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court, calling on a judge to order the NYPD to release information about the gang database that they refused to give in a FOIL request sent in 2021 and in prior years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“(The) NYPD did not respond to the 2021 FOIL Request until seventeen months after it was submitted,” the lawsuit notes. “On March 8, 2023—after dozens of follow-up phone calls and emails and two in-person visits to One Police Plaza—the NYPD finally responded to the 2021 FOIL Request by producing a limited set of redacted documents in response to the first five requests, while declining to produce any records in response to the sixth request.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first five requests were about demographic data of people in the gang database, the lawsuit notes. The sixth request, which the NYPD shot down entirely, sought information on the agencies that the NYPD shared the database information with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCommunity advocate groups have been demanding information on the gang database for more than five years, demanding information as to who is in the database and the guidelines for adding and removing people from it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe NYPD holds firm that the database “is a valuable precision policing tool that helps keep the city safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA request for comment about the STOP report was not immediately returned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e     ©2023 New York Daily News.

By midday Tuesday, all of the defendants had filed paperwork pleading not guilty in filings with the court and waived their rights to an arraignment hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eDuring an arraignment hearing, defendants have the right to have the charges against them read and to enter a formal plea. Trump pleaded not guilty in a court filing Thursday and Giuliani entered his plea Friday, with the rest of the pleas trickling in over several days. \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eWhile all of the defendants had filed the paperwork by Tuesday, some of them did not file 48 hours ahead of the scheduled arraignments as required by the judge. And, while the judge requires the waiver to be “personally signed by the defendant,” a lawyer for Misty Hampton, former elections director in Coffee County, filed the waiver without getting Hampton to sign it herself. It was not immediately clear whether the judge would reject any of the waivers as a result.\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eMeadows and four others are seeking to move the charges against them to federal court. But during a hearing last week on Meadows' request, U.S. District Judge Steve Jones made clear that if he had not ruled by the arraignment date or if the case was not moved to federal court, Meadows would not be excused from arraignment.\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eLawyers Kenneth Chesebro and Sidney Powell have each filed demands for a speedy trial, meaning their trials would have to start by early November, and have each asked to be tried alone. The judge scheduled a hearing on Wednesday on their motions to sever themselves from the others. \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eAfter Chesebro filed his speedy trial demand, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis asked McAfee to set an Oct. 23 trial date for all defendants.

      "content": "\u003cp\u003eBALTIMORE — In early July, a Baltimore Police officer’s body-worn camera footage shows him arresting a 16-year-old boy next to a car.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithin seconds of handcuffing the teen, the officer reads him his rights off a script on the officer’s phone. A voice over the officer’s radio instructs him to “just try to find out,” and the officer asks the teen where he got the car, according to footage shown to The Baltimore Sun on the condition a reporter could describe the video but not publish it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the teen opted not to say anything, the question itself violated a new Maryland law that requires police to have an attorney explain an underage defendant’s Miranda rights to them before the youth can decide whether to answer an officer’s questions or remain silent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKnown as the Child Interrogation Protection Act, the law aims to protect kids who don’t understand their rights and are susceptible to pressure from authorities, which can lead to false confessions and coerced statements. More than a third of exonerations nationwide for crimes allegedly committed by youth under 18 involved a false confession, compared to about 11% of cases involving adults, according to the Innocence Project, a nonprofit aimed at getting justice for the wrongfully convicted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe violation caught on body camera is not an isolated incident.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were at least 10 other violations in the city from July alone, according to Jenny Egan, the juvenile division chief for the Baltimore branch of the Maryland Office of the Public Defender. Egan said she also has documented evidence of violations in Anne Arundel, Allegany, Montgomery and Garrett counties, though she is prohibited from sharing the corresponding court records under Maryland law.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat’s more, although Baltimore Police arrested at least 77 youth in July, including at least one teen in connection to the Brooklyn Homes mass shooting, the public defender’s office received only one call in July from the city to its 24/7 Youth Access to Counsel hotline, which connects public defenders to underage defendants in order to advise them of their Miranda rights.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It was the Maryland State Police calling about a child they brought in on a Wicomico warrant,” Egan said. “We got calls from Charles County, [Prince George’s County], Montgomery County, Baltimore County, Carroll County, Ocean City, and others — but none from BPD.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor comparison, a similar hotline in Washington state was utilized more than 3,300 times in its first 18 months of existence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile it is possible those 77 youth arrested in Baltimore consulted with private counsel retained by their families, Baltimore Deputy District Public Defender Alycia Capozello said it is highly unlikely, given that her office represents upwards of 95% of juvenile defendants in the city.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We’re able to say with extreme confidence that yes, this is happening,” Capozello said of the violations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe underage teen arrested in connection to the Brooklyn Homes shooting does have private counsel but was not able to consult with his attorney before officers interrogated him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“They had already begun an interrogation with him before I got down to police headquarters,” said Michael S. Clinkscale, the teen’s attorney.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBaltimore Police did not respond to questions for this article.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s estimated that about 90% of youth defendants waive their Miranda rights, likely because they do not understand them, according to the ACLU of Maryland.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePassed last year by the Maryland General Assembly, the Child Interrogation Protection Act went into effect Oct. 1 and also ensures that parents and guardians will be notified if their child is taken into custody. And it establishes a legal presumption that a statement made by a child during a custodial interrogation is inadmissible if a law enforcement officer willfully failed to comply with the law, although prosecutors could argue for its inclusion in court.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDavid Jaros, a law professor who heads the University of Baltimore School of Law’s Center for Criminal Justice Reform, called a person’s right against self-incrimination and right to an attorney a “bedrock foundational principle” of both the criminal justice system and our Constitutional rights.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The reality is that these kinds of constitutional protections provide a convenient scapegoat for law enforcement to point at when facing criticism about crime,” Jaros said. “But there’s very little evidence that efforts to protect constitutional rights are inhibiting efforts to keep the public safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe violations are coming at a time when Democratic Baltimore State’s Attorney Ivan Bates, among other elected prosecutors, is railing against the Child Interrogation Protection Act, claiming that the law is hampering investigations during what he called an increase in youth crime. While the number of people arrested under age 18 in Baltimore this year has increased compared to the corresponding period last year, the number is about half of pre-pandemic totals, according to a review of Baltimore Police data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“This is what I don’t get: Even if the parent says yes you can talk to their child, a lawyer, the public defender, is saying you can’t talk to my client,” Bates said during an appearance on WBAL Radio’s “C4 and Bryan Nehman Show” in early August, making reference to the investigation into the Brooklyn Homes shooting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Of course they’re not saying you can talk to anyone,” Bates added of the public defender’s office. “They’re shutting it down. Matter of fact, I received an email from a public defender in Baltimore City reminding me what the law was, almost waving it in my face, ‘Hey you can’t do this.’ That’s the mentality now given to the public defenders here in Baltimore City.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office shared with The Sun the email Bates referenced, in which Capozello wrote to him July 7 that she wanted to “highlight that [the public defender’s office] is here to help facilitate adherence to the Child Interrogation Protection Act.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCapozello said the attacks on the new law are deflections from the police department’s own flawed investigations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We have the state’s attorney and other city officials repeatedly speaking out against a law that’s meant to protect the constitutional rights of children at a time when the city’s in the midst of implementing a consent decree that it’s in because of a pattern and practice of unconstitutional policing,” Capozello said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eState Sen. Jill Carter, a Baltimore City Democrat who sponsored the law, called Bates’ and other state’s attorneys’ complaints that police cannot interview kids who were witnesses to a crime “the dumbest and most ridiculous thing” she’s ever heard in her life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“What we’re dealing with now is misinformation on the part of law enforcement and state’s attorneys who are unhappy with the current state of the law,” Carter said in an interview with The Sun. “They’re seeking to win public support by being dishonest about the law, which requires them in many cases to do more work. It requires them to honor the rights of the children. And that’s something they’re clearly resistant to.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTold about the apparent violations by Baltimore Police, Carter said it wasn’t surprising to her as the department “does not have a history of abiding by the law.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a statement to The Sun, a spokesman for Bates called the legislature’s decision to require that underage defendants consult with an attorney before being interviewed “misguided and harmful.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eState’s attorney spokesman James Bentley added that because any questioning of underage defendants has to be recorded, their rights already are safeguarded.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There can be no legitimate contention that placing restrictions on law enforcement’s ability to interview those juveniles involved in violence will promote public safety or accountability,” Bentley wrote in an email. “Instead, the law acts as a barrier to solving the cases, which leads to further violence and retaliation throughout the community.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe attacks on the Child Interrogation Protection Act are not contained to mainstream or conservative Democrats, either. Despite joining former Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby in support of the law during the 2022 legislative session, Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy also has cried foul.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The juvenile interrogation law that was passed by the Maryland legislature I think had good intentions,” Braveboy said in an interview with WUSA9, the Washington CBS affiliate, earlier this year. “But the results have been that young people are less willing to provide critical information to solve crimes that occur here, not only in Prince George’s County but throughout Maryland ... That law has really been a problem for us.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFormer Republican Gov. Larry Hogan vetoed the law last year, but the Democratic supermajority in 2022 overrode him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJaros, the law professor, said these arguments from prosecutors mirror the protestations made more than half a century ago when the U.S. Supreme Court determined police have to inform a person of their right to remain silent and right to an attorney before questioning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The thing that’s often missed in this conversation is that there’s overwhelming evidence that when people are properly informed of their rights, they still talk to law enforcement,” Jaros said. “We’ve had Miranda on the books for over half a century now, and yet despite all of the claims that the world would end for law enforcement, people are still confessing.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e–––––\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e     ©2023 The Baltimore Sun.

      "content": "\u003cp\u003eORLANDO, Fla. — Local attorneys and lawmakers gathered at the Orange County Courthouse to demand that suspended State Attorney Monique Worrell be reinstated a month after she was removed by Gov. Ron DeSantis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTuesday’s press conference in the courthouse courtyard held in solidarity with Worrell, who wasn’t present, happened at the same time as others organized in Tampa and Miami. Though few supporters attended, those who did spoke out against Worrell’s removal and called it “unconstitutional.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s been nearly a month since Worrell was suspended after months of back-and-forth with law enforcement leaders accusing her of not prosecuting crime aggressively enough. Much of the scrutiny came in light of several high-profile shootings in Orange County, including one in Pine Hills that resulted in the killings of three people, including a child and a TV news reporter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDeSantis replaced her Aug. 9 with Orange County Judge Andrew Bain, who is a member of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I find it very ironic to be in a place of justice here at the Orange County Courthouse as we are dealing with an issue of injustice,” state Rep. Anna Eskamani said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWorrell is the second state attorney to be ousted by DeSantis in a year, with Hillsborough County prosecutor Andrew Warren being suspended in August 2022 after pledging to not pursue abortion cases. Critics of the governor have accused him of a power grab against progressive prosecutors in Florida’s cities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOthers have also expressed concern at the creation of a committee exploring the possibility of consolidating judicial districts, which Democrats fear will dilute their voting power in urban districts. Last month, state attorneys, public defenders and lawmakers from around the state unanimously spoke out against the proposal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There were probably over 100 people that spoke, and not one person said that this was a good idea,” state Rep. LaVon Bracy Davis said. “So if for whatever reason this happens, just know it’s not the will of the people.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWorrell is gearing up to file a lawsuit pushing back against her suspension. Warren made a similar move in the months following his ouster.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA federal judge agreed the suspension violated Warren’s free speech rights, but ruled he didn’t have the authority to reinstate the state attorney. The Florida Supreme Court rejected Warren’s lawsuit, saying he took too long to file it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e     _____     ©2023 Orlando Sentinel. Visit at orlandosentinel.com.

But, with No. 11 Texas coming to town this weekend, it's important that both Tyler Buchner and Ty Simpson keep their heads up — either could find themselves in a situation where they're on the field.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuchner was the second signal-caller in the game for Alabama on Saturday — entering the game with the Crimson Tide up 42-0. Buchner went 3-for-25 for 27 yards while also adding a rushing touchdown. Simpson was next, completing just one pass for five yards — also adding a rushing score on a QB sneak play late.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"I thought both guys handled the situation well,\" Saban said on Monday. \"They executed fairly well. I think it’s a good opportunity for both of them to be able to learn from some of the things that they did, get some really good game experience. I thought they both did a good job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlabama running back Jase McClellan went as far as to say there was \"no falloff\" within the quarterback depth chart.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"I think those guys came in and showed that there was no falloff at that position,\" McClellan said. \"They played well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf Milroe continues to play like he did in Week 1, there won't be any doubt who the Crimson Tide's quarterback will be.

      "content": "\u003cp\u003eA new book about Joe Biden portrays the president as someone whose middle-class upbringing helped foster a resentment of intellectual elitism that shaped his political career and sometimes caused strain with his onetime boss, Harvard-educated Barack Obama. \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eBiden, who spent eight years as Obama's vice president, told a friend that Obama couldn't even curse properly, according to “The Last Politician: Inside Joe Biden’s White House and the Struggle for America’s Future.\" \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eReleased Tuesday and written by Franklin Foer, a staff writer for The Atlantic, the book says Biden said Obama was unable to deliver a \"f—- you\" with \"the right elongation of vowels and the necessary hardness of consonants; it was how they must curse in the ivory tower.”\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eNow, as the president runs for reelection, the early frontrunner among Republicans is former President Donald Trump, whose supporters can sometimes resent the perceived elitism of Washington's political class — suggesting some overlap with Biden. \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eThe anecdote also may resonate with Democrats. Ardent supporters of both Biden and Obama fondly recall the then-vice president telling Obama in a private aside that was captured on a hot mic, “This is a big f—-ing deal,” during the signing ceremony for Obama's signature health care law in 2010. \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eFoer's book offers a deep examination of Biden's first two years in office, which the author describes as encompassing a lot of “flailing” before the president began to cement his legacy through signature policy achievements and “creative diplomacy” that helped rally the world behind Ukraine in the face of Russia's invasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eThe 80-year-old Biden continues to face questions about his age, and Foer calls it “striking” that Biden attends few meetings or public events before 10 a.m. In private, Biden would “occasionally admit to friends he felt tired,\" the book says. \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked last week by a reporter citing an early excerpt from Foer's book if personal fatigue might help explain why Biden's morning schedule was often light. She responded, “That’s a ridiculous assumption to make.”\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eJean-Pierre referred back to that exchange during her briefing with reporters at the White House on Tuesday, and provided updated comment, saying that administration officials had now “seen the context of the excerpt.\" She said the book was actually praising Biden for helping to push major legislation through Congress and unify global support around Ukraine. \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eIt \"seemed to be making the opposite overall point about how the value of his experience and wisdom resulted in rallying the free world against authoritarianism,” she said. \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eJean-Pierre also said “there’s gonna be a range, always, a range of books that are about every administration” that would feature “a variety of claims.” \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003e“That’s not unusual. That happens all the time,” she said. \"And we’re not going to litigate here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eFoer's book also describes struggles by Vice President Kamala Harris to carve out a role for herself as Biden's No. 2 that have been well-documented previously. But Foer suggests Harris may have hurt her own cause in that area, initially asking to be in charge of relations with Scandinavia because it was “away from the spotlight.” \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eThe book reports that the vice president was initially excited about helping the administration tackle the root causes of immigration that have seen so many Central American migrants seeking asylum arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border — but that she eventually began to accept conventional wisdom that it was a thankless assignment. \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eFoer's book says Biden tried to treat Harris more respectfully than he felt Obama often had treated him as vice president, calling her “the vice president\" instead of “my vice president.\" But, during his early days in office, as Biden was convening his team to combat the coronavirus pandemic, Biden joked that the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, should sit in the vice president's seat. \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003e“The Last Politician” describes the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. It says that when Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, relayed to the president that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had fled the country, leaving Kabul to fall to the Taliban, Biden declared in frustration, “Give me a break!”\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eIt also reports that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton personally intervened to help many women whose work in Afghanistan made them potential targets for the Taliban. She directed a group of them to wear white scarfs so they could be identified by U.S. Marines guarding the Kabul airport, and unilaterally contacted world leaders to find places for their eventual evacuation flights to land. \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eThe book says Clinton's call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy drew a personal rebuke from Sullivan, former close advisor to Clinton, who told her “What are you doing calling the Ukrainian government?” \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t have to call if you guys would,\" Clinton responded, according to Foer's book. \u003c/p\u003e\n            ",

These services can range from medical support like administering insulin injections or assistance with daily tasks such as bathing and dressing. Someone with permanent mobility issues, for example, may need this kind of assistance for the rest of their lives, while others may only benefit for a few years following an accident or medical incident.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe setting in which long-term care is delivered is also situational — some people may receive assistance from a family member or home health aide, but many will require higher-level custodial care in a licensed health care institution like a nursing home or rehab center.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDo I really need long-term care insurance, and what does it cost?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eRegardless of need, long-term care services can be expensive\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e The U.S. median annual cost of a private room in a nursing home without insurance is roughly $9,034 a month, according to a \u003ca href=\"https://www.genworth.com/aging-and-you/finances/cost-of-care.html\"\u003e2020 report\u003c/a\u003e from life insurance company Genworth. The median cost for an assisted living facility is over $54,000 annually, and a home health aide is almost $62,000 a year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor many older people on a fixed income, and even their relatives who may provide financial support, these costs are too exorbitant to pay out-of-pocket.

But even when employers do offer this benefit, they don’t usually pay the premium cost, so employees must pay the premium in full.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat said, if you’re still working, it’s best to see if your employer offers more affordable long-term care coverage compared to what it would cost to purchase a single policy. Whether you choose group insurance or purchase a policy independently, your premium costs will depend on your age, gender, health, policy type and the coverage you select.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to the trade organization \u003ca href=\"https://www.aaltci.org/long-term-care-insurance/learning-center/ltcfacts-2023.php\"\u003eAmerican Association for Long-Term Care Insurance\u003c/a\u003e, the average annual premium for a single man in 2021 with a policy valued at $165,000 would be $950 on average. At 65, a single man would pay an average of $1,700 annually for the same level policy.
