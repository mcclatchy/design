      "content": "\u003cp\u003eFour-time Pro Bowler Chris Harris, who won a Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos in 2015, has visited — and competed in — a lot of football stadiums during his four years at the University of Kansas and 12 seasons in the NFL.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 34-year-old Tulsa, Oklahoma native, who played defensive back at Kansas from 2007 to 2010, is convinced that the Jayhawks’ soon-to-be renovated David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium will be one of the best places to watch football in the entire country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Oh man … from the looks of it, it’s going to fit right in there with a lot of the top NFL stadiums,” Harris said on Tuesday, speaking with media members after KU \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/college/big-12/university-of-kansas/article278243263.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003ereleased plans for a new-look stadium to open in August of 2025\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“A lot of NFL teams are starting to redesign their stadiums kind of in this format,” added Harris, who sat on a stage with KU chancellor Douglas Girod, athletic director Travis Goff, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, football coach Lance Leipold and running back Devin Neal at a stadium-unveiling extravaganza at the Jayhawk Welcome Center, across from the Kansas Union on campus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“They are older stadiums doing a lot of reconstruction things. This is the new standard. It’s the new level standard,” Harris added of KU’s upcoming renovated stadium. “It’s going to have multiple events. You are going to have concerts, all types of things going on in this stadium. It’s going to be great. I would call it all-purpose. It’ll be an all-purpose events center to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKU’s stadium renovation plan is part of a proposed Gateway District to campus to include new retail and dining amenities and possibly office spaces, a hotel and maybe even a new campus dorm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/college/big-12/university-of-kansas/article278283188.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eentire project has a $300 million price tag\u003c/a\u003e, of which $50 million is going to Allen Fieldhouse renovations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe actual football field will include seating that is closer to the action on the field. There will be chair-back seating in the west and north seating areas and a videoboard 2 1/2 times larger than the current one — and 60 feet closer to the field.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, there will be a 50% increase in area per seat and 50% more leg room, per a KU release. There will be 2,300 club seats in three different locations, social zones and concourses with four times more food and beverage options than now, as well as new restrooms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother former KU football standout, Todd Reesing, also chimed in on the same question put to Harris: Where will this renovated stadium rank out of all stadiums?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s tough to get the final experience from just the renderings,” the 35-year-old Reesing, who played at KU from 2006 to 2009, said. “From the view of having the Campanile (north of stadium) there from a visual standpoint, coupled with fans being much more on top of the field to create more volume and crowd noise, I think it’s going to be as good as any place to play in the Big 12.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe said it’s vital KU improves its football stadium.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It is a huge recruiting tool,” Reesing said. “The recruiting landscape has changed with NIL, with facilities, with different uniform combinations. All that factors in to try to get the best talent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“For KU to compete at the level we all want them to compete at, to win championships, to go to bowl games, we have to have facilities that match that. The fact we are putting that as a priority from the chancellor down to the athletic director shows that is an important driver for Kansas to generate more revenue to support other sports, also to create excitement in the university as a whole.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHarris agreed that college football “has just exploded. With the way the NCAA has changed.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“With NIL, it’s totally different compared to when I played.,” Harris said. “You’ve got to be able to compete with the other schools. Innovation and things coaches are bringing to the table to get guys, it’s all competition. Recruiting is a competition. We have to have these facilities, this new stadium to be able to keep up with the top schools in the nation.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReesing actually sampled part of the renovation project on Tuesday. He worked out in KU’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/college/big-12/university-of-kansas/article278024078.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003enewly remodeled weight room in the Anderson Family Football Complex\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The weight room … it brought back some memories to get back in there and lift a little bit of weights before we got to the big announcement today,” Reesing said. “To see the first phase of the renovation, the locker room, the weight room, they did an amazing job. I can’t wait to see what they are going to do with the rest of this stuff the next couple years.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHarris, who played last season with the New Orleans Saints but is not in an NFL camp at this time, did not work out in Lawrence on Tuesday. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow living in Dallas, he said returning to Lawrence would be a priority each fall from now on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I’m looking forward to coming back here, having a great time in that stadium. That’s what I’m looking forward to as a former player,” Harris said. “The guys coming up, guys playing now can build that brick, keep that excitement going so when it’s time to get in that new stadium the excitement is through the roof. That’s their job, to keep the same momentum we have now, to turn it up another level when it’s time for the new stadium to open.”\u003c/p\u003e",

He opened up the scoring by draining a 3 from the top of the key. Then he knocked down another 3 and converted a layup to give K-State an 8-7 lead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe was far from done. Kaluma went on make plays on the perimeter and in the paint on his way to a team-high 23 points.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of his best moments came on a fadeaway jumper in the lane that gave the Wildcats a 66-59 lead late in the third quarter. He didn’t settle for anything.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were some questions about how long it would take him to fit into Tang’s offense as a newcomer, but it seems like he is making an easy transition to his surroundings. Kaluma should provide a scoring spark on the wing and help K-State replace Keyonte Johnson this season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s also worth mentioning that Tylor Perry hit some important shots in his first game action with the Wildcats. He scored 17 points. The North Texas transfer wasn’t quite as impressive as Kaluma, but his ability to make shots on the perimeter helped K-State in this one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCam Carter appears ready for a bigger role\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eK-State relied so heavily on its top three scorers last season that Cam Carter occasionally got lost in the shadows of Markquis Nowell, Nae’Qwan Tomlin and Johnson. But there will be nowhere for him to hide next season. It seems like he is good with that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCarter looked like a more aggressive player in this game on his way to 17 points.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe fired away when he was open from 3-point range, broke free for a transition dunk and was involved on defense. He also had a nifty full-court assist in the fourth quarter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWas it a perfect game for the junior? No, far from it. But it’s clear he is ready, and capable, of being more than just a solid role player for the Wildcats from now on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR.J. Jones was also a key contributor in the backcourt, as he finished with 13 points.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWildcats show resilience in exhibition game\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a while, it looked like K-State might cruise to an easy victory over Israel Select.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t work out that way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIsrael Select fought back from an early deficit and took a 44-43 lead early into the third quarter. It was a back-and-forth game from there, with Israel Select tying things up at 78-78 with 5:03 to play. It was anybody’s game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVictory was far from a given on the road against a team of professional basketball players. But the Wildcats dug deep and found a way to pull away for the win.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eK-State toughened up on defense and started to get a lot of stops. Kaluma and Perry both hit some big shots to give the Wildcats a lead. Carter got to the free-throw line. Tang was able to celebrate a win on foreign soil.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWinning isn’t always the most important thing on a trip like this. Sometimes it’s more important to spread minutes around and let everyone on the team gain valuable on-court experiences before the season arrives. Tang even said beforehand that he wasn’t concerned about wins or losses in this summer. But K-State found a way to win all the same.\u003c/p\u003e",

      "content": "\u003cp\u003eBy the end of the year, the University of Kansas will \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/college/big-12/university-of-kansas/article278243263.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003ebegin construction on a more than $300 million project\u003c/a\u003e to renovate the school’s football stadium and the area around it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUniversity officials are still working to raise another $135 million for the project. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a release Tuesday, university officials said they planned to open the new stadium in time for the 2025 college football season. The “Kansas Gateway District” will ultimately include a new convention center near the stadium as well as a multi-use space to house restaurants, retail, lodging, offices and “arts and entertainment.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost of the funding will be dedicated to the football stadium and “Gateway” project, while $50 million \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/college/big-12/university-of-kansas/article276037761.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003ewill go to Allen Fieldhouse renovations\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe university said it planned to primarily use private donors to fund the project and would not use student tuition dollars or the Kansas state general fund, the primary fund of tax revenues which builds the state’s yearly budget. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the university fails to meet its fundraising goal, KU still has a plan in place, according to Kansas athletic director Travis Goff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“To emphasize also that (donor funding is) the primary funding vehicle,” Goff said, “(KU) Athletics if needed can borrow against the project and borrow against future revenues that the project will drive that allows us to invest in an even higher level to see this through. The final maybe comment to that is what we’ve built today achieves approximately 70% of a new facility. We have work to do to tackle the east and kind of of that connectivity to the south (to) finish this whole vision.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere are the financial components going into the project and how the university plans to raise the remainder. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eGovernment spending\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough the university said it used no state general fund dollars to finance the project, $85 million in government spending will be used. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat funding includes a $50 million grant from the Kansas Department of Commerce and $35 million in federal COVID-19 relief dollars. The government funds will be focused on the portions of the project aimed at economic development, such as the convention center and multi-use spaces, rather than the new stadium itself. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast year, Kansas lawmakers allocated $75 million to the Kansas Department of Commerce to create the University Challenge Grant Program using federal COVID-19 relief dollars. The program provides matching funds to Kansas colleges pursuing economic development funds. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn February the agency announced recipients, including $50 million for the University of Kansas. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Legislature also allocated $35 million to the university last year from the $1.2 billion sent to the state through the American Rescue Plan Act. The American Rescue Plan ACT was a COVID-19 relief package signed by President Joe Biden. The funding for KU was earmarked for economic development.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt an event announcing the project’s timeline, KU chancellor Douglas Girod said the two pots of money allocated by the Legislature last year were important “to really kick off this program.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278286668; alt=\"undefined\"% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDemocratic Gov. Laura Kelly presented the project as an extension of her administration’s focus on economic development and job growth, bringing 720 jobs to Lawrence and the potential for national and regional conventions. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“These new and improved facilities will benefit not only KU, by increasing student enrollment and attracting new visitors to campus, but also the surrounding community and our entire state,” Kelly said. “More talented students graduating from KU means more talented people entering the Kansas workforce.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eFundraising\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThus far, the University has raised $165 million of its $300 million funding goal, officials said. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAround $125 million of that fundraising has come since the project was announced last year. David Booth, a KU alumnus and donor, \u003ca href=\"https://www2.kusports.com/news/2017/sep/23/donor-david-booth-explains-his-50m-gift-ku-footbal/\"\u003eannounced in 2017\u003c/a\u003e he would give the university $50 million for the new stadium. The donation was spread out into $10 million installments per year. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278286303; alt=\"undefined\"% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKU officials said the university was still working to raise the additional $135 million to reach their goal. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The total goal from a fundraising perspective is $300 million, of which about 250 is allocated for this project remaining and 50 is focused on Allen Fieldhouse renovations that are underway,” Goff said. “We’re not going to just hit 300 — we’re going to surpass it. So, that’s (what) it’s going to take, and we have great confidence in our momentum and fundraising perspective of the way our supporters have stepped up.”\u003c/p\u003e",

      "content": "\u003cp\u003ePicking up where he left off Sunday as a good-hands wide receiver, Nikko Remigio laid out for a deep pass down the sideline. He slipped behind cornerback Dicaprio Bootle and got his hands on the ball before sprawling to the turf.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut unlike Sunday, when Remigio led the Chiefs with four receptions for 71 yards in Kansas City’s preseason opener against the New Orleans Saints, he didn’t jump up and return to the huddle. Remigio stayed down, which quickly attracted the attention of the Chiefs’ medical staff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRick Burkholder, vice president of sports medicine and performance, was among those who escorted Remigio to the injury tent, where he received treatment before leaving practice for good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRemigio suffered a dislocated left shoulder, head coach Andy Reid said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRemigio was one of three wide receivers injured in Tuesday’s practice, along with Justyn Ross (leg) and Ihmir Smith-Marsette (groin).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReid later provided updates on all three. Ross left with a knee/hamstring injury and was being checked out after practice by the team’s trainers. Reid said Smith-Marsette left with an injured groin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for Remigio, “The shoulder’s back in,” Reid said. “We’ll just see how this thing goes.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRemigio has become something of a training camp darling after going undrafted this spring. He spent five years in college, the first four at California and a fifth at Fresno State. The 5-foot-9 Remigio is coming off is best college season: 74 receptions and six touchdowns; he also rushed for two touchdowns.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe’s had a solid training camp, playing mostly with the twos and threes, and is attempting to break through at a deep position group.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278271948% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Nikko Remigio, that’s my boy,” said rookie wide receiver Rashee Rice. “He’s been killing it. For him to go undrafted, I don’t really understand why. But he’s been showing everybody why he should have been drafted.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Sunday’s game, Remigio made the most of his 18 offensive snaps. He caught two of the three longest passes thrown by Chiefs quarterbacks, a 24-yarder from Shane Buechele and a 22-yarder from Chris Oladokun.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe also returned a kickoff and a punt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“He had a nice game,” Reid said. “Did some really good thing specials teams-wise and in the throwing game.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne more thing: As Remigio looks to heal up and make a name for himself in the NFL, he asks that you say his name correctly. He even took to Twitter on Monday with a pronunciation guide.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“knee-CO ruh-me-HEE-o” he tweeted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278272763% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Some were beginning to wonder if it was too late in the recruiting calendar to land any new players before the start of the fall semester. But that was never much of a concern for Tang, and he proved why on Tuesday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGlover averaged 14.7 points, 2.5 rebounds and 2.1 assists as a Samford guard last season. Before that, he averaged 19.2 points as a junior. That production came after he started out his college basketball career at Florida and played sparingly while appearing in 51 games for the Gators.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eK-State coaches have been looking for an extra guard with experience to add to a backcourt that already features Cam Carter and Tylor Perry. Glover will most likely be used as a complementary player behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany different schools tried to recruit Glover when he announced that he was looking for a new home after he finished up the 2022-23 season at Samford. He originally committed to BYU but later backed out of that arrangement to explore his options.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the past few weeks, that brought new attention from schools like Indiana and Illinois. He considered them but decided to commit to K-State.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost, if not all, of Glover’s recruitment with K-State happened via phone and Zoom. Glover did not make a recruiting visit to Manhattan and the Wildcats have been overseas on a foreign tour for the past week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eK-State \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansas.com/sports/college/big-12/kansas-state/article278266428.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003edefeated Israel Select 94-87 during an exhibition game\u003c/a\u003e on Tuesday.

And the one thing that could disrupt this offense is penalties. And we know that when you’re ushering in two new tackles starting in the system. And you’re right, we’ve seen Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid overcome a lot. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The one thing we haven’t seen them overcome is bad offensive line play. It’s been an issue here before in this franchise as we’ve seen and I’m not just pointing to the Super Bowl (LV). You can point back to when they were struggling a little bit early in the season. That unit wasn’t playing great throughout that stretch. ... That offensive line was playing into a lot of what that offensive struggle was for this team.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpears and Orlovsky both noted the importance of the Chiefs reaching a deal with defensive tackle Chris Jones. He’s missed all of training camp while holding out for a new contract.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Spears reiterated that the offensive line will be the key to the Chiefs’ hopes this season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“They are not going to win the Super Bowl on defense, they are going to win it because of Patrick Mahomes and this unit that they put around him from a protection standpoint,” Spears said. “I’m not even worried about the wide receivers because Travis Kelce is there. I don’t care who is playing wide receiver as long as Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes are on the field. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“But ultimately, if we are sitting here saying, ‘Dang man, did you see what has happened to Kansas City? Or Kansas City didn’t get back to the Super Bowl or back to the AFC Championship,’ I think we will squarely point to protection for Patrick Mahomes from those tackles spots. I don’t think it’s gonna be an issue, but I can’t say they’re gonna be better leading into the season trying to put two new guys in that position.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003ePenalty numbers\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpears is particularly concerned about Smith, who was the second-most penalized player in the NFL last season. He was flagged for \u003ca href=\"https://www.footballdb.com/stats/penalties-player.html?yr=2022\u0026tm=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eholding seven times\u003c/a\u003e, the most of any player, per the Football Database. That was in 13 games.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, in the 2021 season, Smith played all 17 games and was called for holding just three times. Taylor, however, was called eight times for holding that year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Patrick Mahomes’ ability to run and improv in the playoffs are a big reason why the Kansas City Chiefs have so much success in winning Super Bowls,” Spears said. “I get concerned when a play goes for seven seconds, and there’s a tackle on the field that is susceptible to holding defensive lineman, and he’s gonna play a lot of really good outside rushers in the AFC this year. That’s my only issue.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere is that \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kftVVUIQ1Xw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003eESPN discussion\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278268853% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

      "content": "\u003cp\u003eThe arrival of Lionel Messi to Major League Soccer has delivered a significant number of eyeballs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince Messi joined Inter Miami last month, the team’s owner, Jorge Mas, claims the number of subscribers to MLS Season Pass on Apple TV has doubled.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Messi effect has been undeniable during the Leagues Cup: Inter Miami, MLS’ worst team through more than half the season, has reached the semifinals. It helps that stars Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets have joined their former Barcelona teammate in South Beach. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMessi could write another thank-you note to the host of players who have missed their mark in defending him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut none of that affects Sporting Kansas City directly ... at the moment. In the longer run, you’ll likely see some sort of change in the league’s roster rules, perhaps as soon as next year. It’s rumored to have been a major topic of discussion at the MLS owners’ meetings during the All-Star break.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChanges in the rules governing roster construction would seem to be the most likely way the Messi effect could touch Sporting KC. Ownership would likely have to spend even more on the roster to keep up. Before Messi’s debut, Sporting’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/soccer/sporting-kc/article277541543.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\"\u003ePeter Vermes predicted\u003c/a\u003e the Argentine soccer star’s arrival would force other clubs to “up the ante.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Everybody loves saying, ‘Let’s spend money,’ and I’m sure that’s not what the owners want to hear all the time,” Vermes said. “But I just think that’s the cost of doing business as the league continues to evolve.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo in short, yes. Messi’s arrival will undoubtedly pressure mid-market teams to find new ways to be competitive with those who can, and will, spend big. Whether this means increasing spending and/or finding more efficiencies in their approach to roster-building, Sporting KC and other teams face a new challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eNow on to some of your questions about both Sporting KC and the KC Current, as fielded via social media:\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278249823% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Current have certainly investigated a few names for the full-time role. But they’re in their stretch run and are the healthiest they’ve been in months.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey’ll likely continue to let Caroline Sjöblom handle the reins through the rest of the season and into the playoffs, if they can make that push.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Current have lost just three matches across all competitions since June. Defensively, they’ve become sound, conceding just four goals in their last six matches. And they are putting the ball into the back of the net. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for what happens after the season? It depends on how this team performs down the stretch. If they make the postseason or narrowly miss out, Sjöblom will get some consideration for the role. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDon’t be surprised if Vlatko Andonovski is also in the mix. The World Cup cycle is complete, the USWNT coach is a proud Kansas City resident and Current owners Chris and Angie Long like to swing for the fences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278250013% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn response to the first question, here’s what I would like see changed: the rule requiring a team that wants to use three U-22 initiative slots to have one of their three designated player spots filled by a player whose salary is under the max budget charge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt hampers what a team can pay one of its DPs. And if that team chooses to pay the full DP slot, it’s unable to capitalize on a young player signing that, hypothetically, could turn into financial profit down the road. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRegarding the second question, Sporting certainly is not out of contention. Sure, the teams ahead have games in hand, but they will face some heavier fixture congestion ahead that Sporting won’t. And Sporting is just three points off the playoff line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving dropped the most points in the league from a winning position, they’re arguably farther down the table than their quality has shown to be at times. Then again, at some point we may have to agree that this is who they are: a team that can’t close out victories.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf Sporting doesn’t come out of the Leagues Cup break strong, it won’t be long before they’re out of contention. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278250278% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterim Current head coach Caroline Sjöblom told reporters on Monday that next week is the soonest Lauren and Stine Ballisager could get their visas. It will probably be two to three match-weeks before they get integrated into a match-day squad.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278250348% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278250368% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA lot of players’ contract situations will be in limbo next season. Thirteen players are either out of contract or have an option for next year. Alan Pulido’s contract expiration has gotten the most attention, but Gadi Kinda is also out of contract at the end of this season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJohnny Russell is no longer a DP but has been for a while, and his contract has an option for 2024. Among other regulars whose continued presence would require picking up an option: Jake Davis, Remi Walter and Willy Agada.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn short, barring a total collapse down the stretch, a massive roster overhaul would be surprising. But Sporting has ways out if club leadership elects to hit the reset button.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278250553% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Current certainly have the ability to make a run. But they can ill afford another slip-up. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe good news is that they’re just six points out of a playoff spot. The bad: they’re in last place in the regular-season standings. That means there are six teams between them and a postseason spot. The other difficulty is the road ahead: Of their seven remaining regular-season games, just three are at home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey will have road trips to San Diego, Houston, Washington and Gotham. All of those teams currently occupy playoff spots. The Current gained momentum in the Challenge Cup, but now they must go on a scorched-earth tear through their final seven games in order to make the playoffs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278250643% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278250723% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVermes has said the club and Pulido are still in negotiations. At the moment, despite reports from various outlets in Mexico that Pulido and Sporting have reached agreement on an extension, that is still Sporting’s answer about the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany of those reporting an agreement between the two also floated narratives that Chivas and Cruz Azul had made offers to Sporting to acquire Pulido during the summer window. Vermes has repeatedly refuted those reports, saying no club had contacted Sporting about Pulido.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s undoubtedly some optimism around the club that Pulido will suit up in a Sporting kit again next season. But until Pulido signs on the dotted line, that is a hope — not a reality.\u003c/p\u003e",
