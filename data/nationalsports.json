So, you could definitely see he's getting his hand more on balls from interceptions and PBUs [pass breakups] which on defense, I know they're emphasizing that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eForbes recorded a tackle in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/commanders/news/washington-commanders-terry-mclaurin-sam-howell-building-trust-training-camp-baltimore-ravens\"\u003eCommanders\u003c/a\u003e' 17-15 win against the Cleveland Browns, but he's getting far more burn in practice going against McLaurin every day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn Monday night, Forbes should have the opportunity to line up against Baltimore Ravens receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and fellow rookie Zay Flowers when the Commanders host them at FedEx Field.

Out of Coppell, Texas, Radicic was tabbed a five-star prospect and the No. 4 kicker in the nation among 2023 recruits, per \u003ca href=\"https://www.si.com/college/indiana/football/five-star-texas-kicker-nicolas-radicic-commits-to-indiana-football-program\"\u003eKohl's Professional Camps\u003c/a\u003e.

Radicic was one of the top performers during the 2021 Kohl's Winter Ranking camps. He hit multiple field goals that are at the college level and also demonstrated that he has the leg strength on punts to be a great combo specialist. Radicic has the talent to play in college at the Power Five level!\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut to due to his inconsistent availability in practice, Radicic hasn't yet separated himself in the kicking competition. Indiana has given opportunities to Freeman and Quintero, but neither has taken advantage. They both lack experience, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFreeman has been in the program since the 2020 season, but he's primarily been utilized as a kickoff specialist. After a redshirt year in 2020, Freeman performed four kickoffs in 2021 and made both extra-point attempts against Idaho.

      "content": "\u003cp\u003eThe New Orleans Saints play their second preseason game this Sunday when they play at the Los Angeles Chargers. Before that kicks off, the Saints and Chargers will engage of two days of scrimmages against each other Thursday and Friday. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere will be plenty to watch during those three days of action for the Saints, who defeated the Chiefs in their opener last week. NFL.com writer Eric Edholm highlights one area from each team that he'll be watching in this weekend's games. This is what he had to say about the Saints-Chargers matchup. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSAINTS\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Saints already know they’ll be without \u003ca href=\"https://www.nfl.com/players/alvin-kamara/\"\u003eAlvin Kamara\u003c/a\u003e for the first three regular-season games, so the news that rookie RB \u003ca href=\"https://www.nfl.com/players/kendre-miller/\"\u003eKendre Miller\u003c/a\u003e suffered a knee injury against the Chiefs didn’t come at the best time. Miller’s injury isn’t believed to be major, so that’s the silver lining. But it likely will leave New Orleans a bit shorthanded for the final two preseason games, starting Sunday against the Chargers. \u003ca href=\"https://www.nfl.com/players/jamaal-williams/\"\u003eJamaal Williams\u003c/a\u003e is the starter, but ideally, they wouldn’t use him much before the regular season behind. Converted WR \u003ca href=\"https://www.nfl.com/players/kirk-merritt/\"\u003eKirk Merritt\u003c/a\u003e is also banged up, so he’s a question mark, leaving undrafted rookie \u003ca href=\"https://www.nfl.com/players/ellis-merriweather/stats/situational/1958/\"\u003eEllis Merriweather\u003c/a\u003e and recently signed \u003ca href=\"https://www.nfl.com/players/darrel-williams/\"\u003eDarrel Williams\u003c/a\u003e as the slack picker-uppers. Merriweather looked good against the Chiefs and might be closer to making the opening roster than many might realize.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCHARGERS\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat do we make of first-rounder \u003ca href=\"https://www.nfl.com/players/quentin-johnston/\"\u003eQuentin Johnston\u003c/a\u003e’s drops? He had two passes slip through his hands against the Rams last weekend, atoning with a pretty TD grab that could have foreshadowed some red-zone work in the regular season. But he also hasn’t consistently caught the ball in camp practices, according to media reports. If Johnston’s drops continue, would he earn the trust of QB \u003ca href=\"https://www.nfl.com/players/justin-herbert/\"\u003eJustin Herbert\u003c/a\u003e and offensive coordinator Kellen Moore? After all, Johnston was credited with eight drops on 97 targets last season with TCU, and he had a few big ones at his pro day, suggesting an issue that has yet to be rectified. All eyes will be on Johnston -- and his hands -- Sunday against the Saints to see if that worry continues. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278316423; alt=\"c5f01a51-2980-4a90-b9c3-3d9e7edf0cb6\"% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe probably won't see much of Kamara, Williams, or the other projected starters from the Saints against the Chargers. Much of what the coaches will want to accomplish will likely get done during the two days of scrimmages. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMerriweather exhibited power as a runner and solid receiving skills as a receiver last week against the Chiefs. He'll have an opportunity to solidify a backup role with another good performance. Merritt has shown little, some because of his hamstring injury, and needs to put something out there for a chance at a job. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDarrel Williams will see his first action as a Saint after being signed just days ago. The sixth-year veteran and former LSU standout is a terrific receiver and good in space. He'll have an opportunity to solidify depth, crucial with Miller banged up and Kamara missing the first three contests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWilliams, Merriweather, and possibly Merritt should see the majority of the backfield reps. Just as critical will be the performance of the line in front of them. The starting five did a nice job in their brief appearance against Kansas City. However, the backups were atrocious as run blockers and pass protectors. Rookie Nick Saldiveri and veterans Max Garcia, Calvin Throckmorton, Storm Norton, and Lewis Kidd need to do a better job for their backs and quarterbacks to have any chance to get things done. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278316428; alt=\"10e80c24-ace8-4c22-85b6-23539138f3d1\"% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike the Saints, it'll be a little surprising if the Chargers starters play at all. With one of the league's better passing attacks, QB Justin Herbert, RB Austin Ekeler, and WRs Johnston, Mike Williams, Joshua Palmer, and Keenan Allen present an excellent challenge for an outstanding New Orleans secondary. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost of this marquee matchup will be seen during the scrimmage sessions. However, the physical L.A. receivers will test an equally physical and athletic set of Saints corners led by Marshon Lattimore. Second-year CB Alontae Taylor, in particular, looks to bounce back after giving up two big plays against the Chiefs. He's in a battle for the Number 2 corner job with Paulson Adebo and both players have had impressive camps.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, the Chargers also use their backs as receivers a lot.  This will be a big test for the New Orleans linebackers. Demario Davis may not play. However, newly signed LB Jaylon Smith will see his first action. It's also a great opportunity for D'Marco Jackson, Nephi Sewell, and the other inexperienced linebackers on the roster to make coaches and fans feel better about the depth at this position. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eCopyright ABG-SI LLC.

      "content": "\u003cp\u003eSANTA CLARA -- Here's what Brock Purdy, Trey Lance and Sam Darnold did on Day 15 of 49ers training camp.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBROCK PURDY\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eCompleted just 11 of 20 pass attempts and threw two interceptions plus a third that was dropped. To be fair, he also threw two beautiful touchdown passes from the 10-yard line -- one to Brandon Aiyuk in the back-left corner of the end zone, and one to Deebo Samuel in the back-right corner of the end zone. But the story for Purdy is the interceptions. He is becoming a walking turnover. Through 12 practices (he took three days off), he has thrown 10 interceptions, 4 pick-6s and 7 dropped picks. Which means he has thrown 17 interceptable passes in 12 days. Not good. Today, he threw a pass directly to backup linebacker Curtis Robinson, who dropped the pass, because he's a backup. Had he caught it, he had nothing but grass in front of him. Later, Purdy threw another pass directly to Robinson, but this time he caught it, because if you give him two chances, he'll catch one. And then in the red zone, Purdy forced a pass to Brandon Aiyuk, who wasn't open. Deommodore Lenoir reached out and tipped the pass to Tashaun Gipson, who recorded his fourth pick of training camp. Earlier this week, Kyle Shanahan said Purdy would have to melt down in practice to lose his job. Every day Purdy throws multiple interceptable passes feels like a meltdown. He does not appear ready to start Week 1 in a few weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTREY LANCE\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eCompleted 4 of 6 pass attempts, fumbled once and did not score in the red zone. But hey, at least he didn't throw an interception. The 49ers better hope Purdy is ready to start Week 1, because Lance hasn't gotten enough reps in camp to be ready. He clearly is better than he was the last two years, but he still seems like a rookie at times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSAM DARNOLD\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eCompleted 5 of 9 throws and completed a touchdown pass to Brayden Willis from 10 yards out. Darnold isn't great, but he might be the best quarterback on the team -- he arguably has had the best training camp of these three. But the 49ers haven't given him a rep with the first-string offense in more than a week. They're giving both Darnold and Lance crumbs. Which means none of their quarterbacks currently are ready to play. What a waste of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eCopyright ABG-SI LLC.

Get your money. I can’t say anything else, man.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHoward eventually did get his money after a turbulent 2021 summer, one that reached the point where he requested a trade via Instagram before getting his contract adjusted with a promise to revisit it the next offseason, at which time the Dolphins gave him a new deal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHoward was asked about the importance of taking care of the business side of things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“At the end of the day, you’ve got to make sure you’re ready to play football also, though — no matter what you’re going through — because there’s like, some guys just focus on getting paid and stuff like that,\" Howard said. \"Then they forget that you’ve still got to play football if you get paid or if you don’t. You’ve still got to perform. So it’s like, you’ve just got to take care of it and just be a pro. And I’m sure he’s going to do that because he’s a pro.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278315728% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eARMSTEAD CONFIDENT\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003ePro Bowl tackle Terron Armstead also was asked about Wilkins' hold-in after the joint practice with the Houston Texans on Wednesday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Christian is a dawg,\" Armstead said. \"We need him. We need him to win. There’s no question. So he knows what he needs to be ready, to be prepared. He practices and plays harder than anybody I’ve ever seen. You never worry about a guy like him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"We need him. The organization knows we need him.

As a result, he’s hasn’t been participating in team (drills). When he next participates, that will be up to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMcDaniel then was asked whether he was comfortable with where things stand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Every player is like a snowflake, I would say, unique to itself,\" he replied. \"So I’m comfortable with the situation as it stands.

There were issues with the starting unit, but the Broncos still managed to move the ball and lead a touchdown drive, with two more ending in missed field goals. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eObviously, the Broncos need those field goals to connect, along with better results from the run game and better blocking from the offensive line. But it wasn't all bad. With the second preseason game coming up, the hope is to see the Broncos improve those areas, or else it'll be time to raise serious concerns. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to individual performances, multiple players have a lot on the line against the \u003ca href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/team/san-francisco-49ers\"\u003eSan Francisco 49ers\u003c/a\u003e. The following seven players didn't have the best game to open the preseason or were unable to see the field. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith how others looked at the same position, some could be in jeopardy of being cut, while others could be in danger of losing their spot on the depth chart. \u003c/p\u003e\u003csection\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Denver's No. 2 quarterback, Stidham completed a third of his passing attempts, going 5-of-15, with only 50 yards to show. The 10-yard average isn't terrible, but you want more consistency from the backup QB. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStidham led four drives, with one field goal, which came on a four-play, eight-yard drive. He led another 10-play drive that went 19 yards for a missed field goal. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Stidham under center, the Broncos ran 27 plays for 90 yards. While Denver scored once, Stidham also threw an interception. It's safe to say the offense stalled under him, and it was a time when the offensive line was doing somewhat decent. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf Stidham's 50 yards, 26 of them came on one play. It highlights how inconsistent he was, but his issues were how those inconsistencies looked. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStidham was all over the place with his ball placement on throws, and his reads weren't great. The best thing he showed was his athleticism and ability to use his legs to pick up yards. If he isn't more consistent with his throws, he could be at risk of losing the backup job.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://sibforms.com/serve/MUIEACu35tDCvWTU8nrZq3tu-omjLixgehvQuqnYGbQ5JZ8iO1opdYklsdU2qJSc8MsKh-kFeniiedKufe5dsVn4SVS3PQ9kiWBxRrGpeqLnT2jnUHWsKpAnbwxykIv8W6xdyqeJAtpssR8Kq5TptID_USaXtVUx2WmFzTPI1xF92kwWDCs3wqBJpwb4E2CKvf4lLtMun7UipsWP\"\u003eWhat happens next on the Broncos?

However, Payton called out Callaway after practice last week, and the receiver didn't respond in the game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe wide receiver is such a dependent position. They can get open, but they aren't getting a chance if the quarterback doesn't look their way. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCallaway was targeted twice in preseason Game 1, with only one catch for seven yards. Unlike other receivers, what stood out was that he wasn't getting separation consistently enough. Callaway played 19 total snaps, 16 of them as a receiver, and the three snaps as a run blocker left you wanting more. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Broncos' wide receiver room is tight, and the coaches are looking for someone to stand out. This was an excellent opportunity for Callaway with Marvin Mims, Jr. and Brandon Johnson not playing, but he didn't take advantage of it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf Callaway doesn't step up during the week of practice as Payton called for and fails to stand out against the Niners, his roster prospects could be in jeopardy. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were not many expecting Okwuegbunam to make the roster. He entered the game late against the Cardinals and was the fourth tight end to enter the game. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChris Manhertz didn't play, and if you look at the depth chart, Manhertz is the third tight end. With all that in mind, it cements the probability that Okquegbunam and the Broncos are poised to part ways.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOkweugbunam still has issues as a blocker and was never targeted in the game. When he entered the game, the Cardinals were fielding mostly fourth-unit defenders. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat should have been an opportunity for Okwuegbunam, but he didn't make his presence felt. He's always been at risk of getting cut or traded if the Broncos can somehow manage to get something, but if he doesn't step up against the Niners, his chances of making it will be zero. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was a rough night for the Broncos' starting left tackle. Plenty of excuses are available for Bolles, from changing offenses, changing his position coach once again, to even the leg injury that ended his season last October, but his play was that of a college freshman going against NFL All-Pros. And yet, Bolles' lapses came against Dennis Gardeck.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGardeck has been in the NFL since 2018 and has played 480 snaps on defense during the regular season, not in 2018, but over his whole career. He has eight career sacks, seven of which came as a situational pass rusher in 2020. That's who beat Bolles like a drum on Friday night. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Bolles isn't at risk of losing the starting job, it is only because Cameron Fleming wasn't any better. Fleming also has much to lose, as the third and fourth-team tackles looked better than he or Bolles. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Broncos need Bolles to step up, and he wants to keep his job. If he doesn't answer the bell vs. the Niners, it increases the chances of him being benched or potentially released. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCutting Bolles would create nearly $12 million in cap savings with $6 million in dead cap. It would be even better if the Broncos could find a trade partner, but they would need him to look decent to find a potential buyer. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhatever happens, the Broncos can't go forward with Bolles looking like he did against a weak Cardinals defensive front. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt sucks that Purcell is hurt and unable to get out on the field. Even at his age, he can still contribute to the defensive line. However, the Broncos could consider parting ways if he can't get healthy in time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite the issues the Broncos had against the Cardinals, the defensive line did well. It would be hard for Purcell to stick if the Broncos get similar results against the Niners. He has to get healthy and cleared to return to practice as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBrowning is in a similar boat as Purcell, but Browning's timetable to return is known. While he won't be cut, Browning is at risk of losing his spot as the third rusher in the rotation. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJonathon Cooper and Nik Bonitto are doing well in camp and translated it to the first preseason game. If those two keep it up, it significantly boosts the Broncos' pass rush and can change the plans with Browning going forward. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, Essang Bassey had an interception, but it came off a receiver slipping on the field. He also had that weird onside kick recovery, so hats off to him. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, outside of that, it was a rough showing from Bassey. The backup nickel spot is his to lose, as he started the game there, but Ja'Quan McMillian may have something to say about it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMcMillian showed versatility to play inside and on the boundary against the Cardinals, and Bassey doesn't have that. Bassey has to offer more against the Niners if he wants to fend off McMillian and secure the backup job. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFaion Hicks is also there pushing for the job. Bassey is at risk of not making the roster due to the numbers game, losing out to the versatile McMillian, or losing his job outright. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278314688% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr/\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFollow Mile High Huddle on \u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MileHighHuddle\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTwitter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eand \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MileHighHuddle/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSubscribe to Mile High Huddle \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/MileHighHuddle\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eon YouTube\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003efor daily Broncos live-stream podcasts!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eCopyright ABG-SI LLC.

He always seems to be around the football, and when you intercept the great Aaron Rodgers in your first meaningful defensive action in the NFL, the way Blankenship did last November, that only heightens the excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Right now, he got the most picks during camp right now, and I’m kind of jealous because I’m trying to win,” joked Eagles veteran cornerback Darius Slay. “But I don’t really get too much action like that, but dang, I’m jealous because I want to win, but happy for him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“…He makes a lot of plays. He’s been smart. As you can see, he was growing into it last year, playing at a high level, filling in for Chauncey (Gardner-Johnson), and still rotating a little bit. And learning from (Marcus) Epps last year and all that and carrying it over into this year. He’s been doing a great job, communicating, leading the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSlay went on to talk about how Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen refers to white players as 'Milk Check.'\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe cornerback said Blankenship, \"Ain't no Milk Check. He's good milk. He doesn't spoil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBlankenship was an undrafted free agent last year after being the rare five-year, college starter, playing at Middle Tennessee State.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“What makes Reed special is his passion for the game,” said rookie Sydney Brown. “I think that’s what makes him so special. He puts in time on and off the field to better his craft. That’s why he’s a special player.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Then again, his intensity every single day. He brings it. He wants to practice. He wants to play hard. Looking at what he’s done in such a short period of time is encouraging for sure. Reed is who he is because of what he does. He’s a product of the work he puts in.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith K’Von Wallace in the final year of his rookie contract, and Terrell Edmunds and Justin Evans signed to only one-year, free-agent contracts, Brown and Blankenship could be a mainstay as the Eagles’ starting safeties for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Reed has done a tremendous job,” said Wallace. “He’s done nothing but prove that he belongs. I’m definitely excited to see what he does this season. We all are.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBlankenship is entrenched as the starter, Brown still has work to do, but he seems to be developing quickly. Wallace has also had a solid camp and could be playing his way into another contract in Philly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Obviously, they're battling there at safety,” said head coach Nick Sirianni. “...We lost a couple of really good players. Obviously wish them the best, but lost a couple really good players and replaced them with some really good players.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"So that's just competition. I'm looking forward to how that continues to play out at that position, at safety.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eEd Kracz covers the Philadelphia Eagles for SI's EaglesToday.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlease \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/kracze\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003efollow him and our Eagles coverage on Twitter at @kracze.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant the latest in breaking news and insider information on the \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/team/eagles\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhiladelphia Eagles\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/eagles/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClick Here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant even more Philadelphia Eagles news? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/team/eagles\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCheck out the SI.com team page here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eCopyright ABG-SI LLC.

It is often described as a neurological disorder, one that can lead to spasms in the arms and wrists during putting.\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e For much of the past decade, Glover faced those kind of demons on the greens and saw his game suffer through it.\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"I had no control over my faculties sometimes,\" Glover said. “I could just lose all feelings over a 10-inch putt. It was frustrating. I fought it for a long time.\"\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e It is a tribute to Glover’s other skills in hitting a golf ball that he managed to survive in the game going through so much grief just trying to get it in the hole.\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e A two-week run of success that has seen Glover, 43, \u003ca href=\"https://www.si.com/golf/news/from-112-to-playoffs-lucas-glover-captures-stunning-win-wyndham-championship\"\u003ewin the Wyndham Championship\u003c/a\u003e and then \u003ca href=\"https://www.si.com/golf/news/lucas-glover-fedex-st-jude-championship-winner-back-to-back-victories-pga-tour-playoffs\"\u003ethe FedEx St. Jude Championship\u003c/a\u003e to come from out of nowhere to fourth in the FedEx Cup standings has led to him telling the story a few times.\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e But earlier this year, Glover ordered a long putter and started practicing with it. At the Rocket Mortgage Classic last month, he switched to a broomstick-style putter that Adam Scott uses. Even the same make and model. Then he went to work and saw almost immediate success.\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"Making all your tap-ins is nice,\" he said.\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e And Glover wasn’t kidding.\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e The easiest way to quantify it is this: Glover missed 24 putts from 3 feet and in (out of 887) in 2020-21. A year later, he missed 27 from that distance. This year, prior to his win in Greensboro, N.C., he had missed 26 and was ranked 180th on the PGA Tour in strokes-gained putting.\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e With the new putter, he taught himself a split-handed grip in which his left hand is away from his chest holding the top of the club while his right hand is farther down the shaft. (In 2016, anchored putting strokes were banned as part of the Rules of Golf by the USGA and R\u0026A.)\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"I’d always been a streaky putter,\" Glover said Wednesday at Olympia Fields Country Club, where he begins play in the 50-player BMW Championship on Thursday. “When I putted well, I played well. When I putted poorly, I played OK.\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e “But the nervy, yippy stuff didn’t start for three or four years until after the U.S. Open (that he won in 2009). Did I make them all? No. But it wasn’t because of the yips. It was always probably the weakest part of my game but not to the extent that it has been the last 10 years and had been the last 10 years.\"\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Glover’s turnaround began the week after the Memorial Tournament when he tied for 20th at the RBC Canadian Open. Earlier that week, he missed out a playoff spot in a U.S. Open qualifier when \u003ca href=\"https://www.si.com/golf/news/lucas-glover-us-open-qualifier-missed-putt\"\u003ehe missed a short putt on the final green\u003c/a\u003e—although he said it was not due to his previous woes.\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e He missed the cut at the Travelers Championship, but Glover then tied for fourth at the Rocket Mortgage and tied for sixth at the John Deere. He missed the cut at the 3M Open by a shot but said \"I putted well, I just didn’t make any.\"\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Then came the victory at the Wyndham followed by his playoff win Sunday over Patrick Cantlay.\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Prior to the Wyndham, Glover was 112th in FedEx Cup points and need no worse than a two-way tie for second in order to advance to the 70-player playoffs that began last week in Memphis. His win moved him to 49th. Then with another win—and points quadrupled during the playoffs—Glover jumped all the way to fourth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e He’s now a lock for next week’s Tour Championship in Atlanta and is in position to win the FedEx Cup.\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Glover’s story is one of perseverance. As frustrating as his putting problems were, he said he was a good kind of stubborn. He kept working at it.\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"A lot of experimentation for sure with a lot of things,\" he said. \"Before this, the most success I had was with the up-the-arm kind of arm lock that (Matt) Kuchar kind of brought out. I'd pretty much tried everything. If you could come up with it in your head, I probably did, two times, legitimately.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Then if something didn't work, I'd just go back and grab a short one and I'd (say) I'll just out-practice this thing, and I just couldn't do it.\"\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGlover said the new stroke with the split-hand grip is \"a completely different motor skill.

      "content": "\u003cp\u003eBLOOMINGTON, Ind. — Tom Allen is a defensive coach by trade. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat was the first thing the Indiana football coach said at 2023 Big Ten Media Days in July when asked not about his defense but about his quarterbacks. Allen obviously has some influence over the offense, but he's far more comfortable drawing up the X's and O's for a defense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat's why he took over defensive play calling duties in 2022, and on the surface it was a perfectly reasonable plan. Allen was originally hired in 2016 by former coach Kevin Wilson to call the defense for Indiana, and the solid IU defenses in 2019 and 2020 were molded by Allen's defensive system and recruiting acumen. Then-defensive play caller Kane Wommack also played a big part in that success before being hired as the head coach at South Alabama. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Indiana's defense was pretty bad in 2022, and one of Allen's solutions was to hire Matt Guerreri as a coordinator, a safeties position coach and, most importantly, a defensive play caller. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"I chose to call it a year ago because I felt that was best for our program at that time,\" Allen said Wednesday in Indianapolis at Media Days. \"But I've not called it obviously [in the past] with all the different things that are going on, and with the portal and the NIL and just the complexities you now deal with ...in order for us to get better and move forward, I wanted to bring somebody in to be able to call that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuerreri spent 10 seasons as an assistant coach at Duke from 2012-21, and he served as the co-defensive coordinator during his final four seasons with the Blue Devils. In 2022, he worked at Ohio State for coach Ryan Day as a senior advisor and analyst. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAllen hired him away from the Big Ten East powerhouse not because Indiana needed a dramatic shift in the way it approaches defense, but because calling plays for the defense limited his ability to oversee the entire program. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"But I feel like it's important for me to become the best head coach I can be,\" Allen said at Media Days. \"The best game-day manager of the entire game, both sides of the football and special teams, for me not to be focused on calling the defense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Guerreri spoke with the media on Wednesday, he reiterated Allen's points. He spoke of his role in calling the defense as adding to what has been in the past under Allen, rather than making a 180 degree shift. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"Coach Allen has a system. There's fundamentals of how we play defense, how we stop the run, how we pressure the quarterback and how we stop the throw game,\" Guerreri said. \"The tweaks are week-to-week in a game plan. What does the opponent do best, and how do we limit that? And what do we do best?\"\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:278315583% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving a new voice in charge of the defensive side of the ball is fitting for the 2023 Hoosiers. The roster is filled with new faces on both sides of the ball, but particularly on defense, where Allen and Co. hit the transfer portal hard. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.si.com/college/indiana/football/indiana-football-transfer-portal-tracker\"\u003eIndiana brought in 17 defensive transfers during the 2023 offseason\u003c/a\u003e, many of whom are expected to start and/or contribute. Guerreri is new to Bloomington just like they are, and he is working in fall camp to bring the diverse, well-traveled group together as one cohesive unit. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis role as an analyst rather than as a play caller or coach at Ohio State in 2022 might seem like a step back, but Guerreri said the experience will make him a better play caller. While he was not entrenched in the stressful, everyday minutiae that play callers and coaches deal with, he observed the OSU defense from a calmer perspective and got a better understanding of what he wants from his own defenses. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes when you're in the fire, you don't see the bigger picture,\" Guerreri said, describing his role as a defensive analyst. \"It gives you a chance to reassess, and then apply going forward.\" \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReassess and apply going forward is a good way to look at everything Allen did as Indiana's head coach this offseason.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Indiana finished a combined 6-18 over the past two seasons, it was clear big changes were needed. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOut went several position coaches and players (either via graduation or transfer portal). In came college football veterans from other schools and new coaches such as Guerreri. They don't intend to tear down what Allen was previously able to build in Bloomington just a few seasons ago. They aim to revamp it and deliver a new and improved product. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuerreri gets his first chance to show Hoosier nation how he's upgraded the Indiana defense when his old friends at Ohio State come to Bloomington on Sept. 2 for the 2023 season opener. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRelated Stories on Indiana Football\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIU OPPONENT PREVIEW SERIES — OHIO STATE:\u003c/strong\u003e We're previewing all 12 teams that Indiana will face on the football field in 2023, and up first is the one, the only, The Ohio State Buckeyes. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.si.com/college/indiana/football/ohio-state-big-ten-2023-indiana-football-opponent-preview-series-quarterback-secondary\"\u003eCLICK HERE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT CHRISTIAN TURNER BRINGS TO IU: \u003c/strong\u003eThere's almost no one on the Hoosiers' entire roster with as much experience as Wake Forest transfer Christian Turner, and he's ready to round out a versatile Indiana running back trio in 2023.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.si.com/college/indiana/football/christian-turner-dynamic-indiana-running-back-trio-jaylin-lucas-josh-henderson\"\u003eCLICK HERE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRUNNING BACKS, COACHES SEEING IMPROVEMENTS ON O-LINE:\u003c/strong\u003e After an embarrassing performance in the 2022 season, Tom Allen hired Bob Bostad to fix the Indiana offensive line, and everyone from the running backs to other position coaches are already seeing the change they wanted. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.si.com/college/indiana/football/indiana-football-running-backs-coaches-seeing-offensive-line-improvements-in-fall-camp\"\u003eCLICK HERE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eCopyright ABG-SI LLC.
