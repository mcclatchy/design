The much-anticipated return of Tiger Woods is the big news of the week, as he will be teeing it up for the first time since The Open Championship last July. Also in the field are tournament favorite Jon Rahm -- at 15-2 odds -- and world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who checks in at 10-1. They are among 23 of the top 25 players making the trip.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast year, Joaquin Niemann -- at 60-1 -- picked up his second PGA Tour victory by two shots over Collin Morikawa and Cameron Young. Niemann will not be on hand this week to defend his title.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257877363% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGenesis Invitational Odds \u0026 Best Bets to Back\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eOutright Picks\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJustin Thomas\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (+1600): \u003c/b\u003eThomas surged back into form last week with his first top-5 finish since June, ranking third for the tournament in SG: Off-the-Tee and second in SG: Tee-to-Green. It was only a matter of time for the superb ball striker, who gained 8.8 strokes with his long game in Phoenix. He notched three top-10s at Riviera over his last five appearances.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eXander Schauffele\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (+1600): \u003c/b\u003eSchauffele’s results in this event have been consistent, as he has posted a top-25 in all five of his starts, although just one top-10. He started out strong last week with consecutive rounds of 67, so the form is there as well. He appears to be close to putting it all together and winning again soon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWill Zalatoris\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (+4000): \u003c/b\u003eWe’re not sure if Zalatoris is 100% after taking last week off following a missed cut at the Farmers, but at these odds I’m willing to take the risk. He’s finished T26 and T15 in his two appearances at Riviera and ranked 10th in SG: Approach here last year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257877378% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTop-10 Wagers to back\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAlex Noren\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (+650): \u003c/b\u003eComing off a top-10 with Hatton last week, I’ll look at another European in Noren, who has a decent track record here, with four made cuts in four starts and a pair of top-20s. He closed last season with a top-5 in Houston and started the year with another one in a solid field in Abu Dhabi, so I’m going to overlook last week’s missed cut.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWyndham Clark\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (+700): \u003c/b\u003eSince last summer Clark has become more than your average Tour professional, recording seven top-20 finishes over his last 20 starts, including a top-10 last week. He’s a great course fit for Riviera, with his only weakness being that he’s sporadic off the tee. That won’t be as much of a detriment as usual considering how difficult it is for even the most accurate drivers to hit the Riviera fairways at a high clip.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eCam Davis\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (+1200): \u003c/b\u003eDavis has been trending in the wrong direction, but with that comes value, and he does rank 20th in SG: Off-the-Tee despite his struggles. Most of his troubles have been in the short game, so we like his chances to finish near the top of the leaderboard if he can right the ship in that area.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257805393% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHead-to-Head Matchups\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSam Burns (-120) over Cameron Young: \u003c/b\u003eYoung broke through at this event last year with a T2, but he is in the midst of a bit of a sophomore slump. Burns, on the other hand, is full of confidence on the heels of consecutive top-15 results. He has also had success here, notching a third-place finish in 2021. That’s enough for us to pay up slightly on the narrow favorite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eCorey Conners\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (-110) over Keith Mitchell:\u003c/b\u003e Conners lacks a top-10 showing through seven starts this season, but we don’t necessarily need one in a one-on-one bet. He made the cut in six of his last seven starts and has done so despite ranking 165th in SG: Putting. This is an event Mitchell has traditionally skipped because it doesn’t fit his game well, but it’s hard to pass up these designated events. He missed the cut in his only appearance in 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257877363% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGenesis Invitational Betting Tips\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCourse Characteristics\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePar-71, 7,322 yards\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eAverage Strokes Gained Rankings: The Genesis Invitational Winners Since 2018\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSG: Off-the-Tee: \u003cb\u003e19.6\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSG: Approach: \u003cb\u003e9.2\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSG: Around-the-Green: \u003cb\u003e14.6\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSG: Putting: \u003cb\u003e17.8\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSG: Tee-to-Green: \u003cb\u003e4.0\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDriving Distance: \u003cb\u003e15.8\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDriving Accuracy: \u003cb\u003e45.6\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eRiviera plays as one of the tougher tests on Tour and doesn’t provide many scoring opportunities outside of the short and downhill par-5 first hole that plays more like a par-4. The par-3s average nearly 200 yards and all but two of the par-4s are under 430 yards. One of those is one of the most recognizable holes on Tour in the driveable par-4 10th that is surrounded by bunkers -- a risk/reward hole that will yield birdies and also plenty of double bogeys. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTee-to-green play has been a key to success, with the champion ranking top-3 in that category three straight years. Distance off the tee gets a premium over accuracy due to a lack of deep rough or hazards. I’ll be targeting players that do a good job of avoiding bogeys and those that approach it well from 150-200 yards, with many iron shots coming in that range. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257805393% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRegal at Riviera\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe following golfers, with a minimum of eight rounds played, have the lowest scoring average at Riviera County Club over the last five years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eViktor Hovland: 68.4\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMax Homa: 69.0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJon Rahm: 69.4\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCollin Morikawa: 69.4\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdam Scott: 69.5\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTony Finau: 69.5\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eHovland will be making his third trip to Riviera. He found immediate success, notching back-to-back top-5 finishes. He has excelled with his ball striking at this venue, ranking top-20 in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green and SG: Approach both years. He’s due for a bounceback following a mediocre T42 in Phoenix, where he lost 4.6 shots around the green and putting combined. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the only two-time winner in the field is Scott, who went 15 years between victories before coming out on top in 2020. Despite a strong finish to last season and a runner-up at the Australian Open in December, he seems somewhat overlooked by the oddsmakers, ranking outside the top 20 choices on the board at 55-1. I like Scott as a mid-range DFS option as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257877378% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTrending in Tee-to-Green\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese five players gained the most strokes from tee to green over their last 20 rounds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRory McIlroy: 2.30\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eScottie Scheffler: 2.05\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eXander Schauffele: 1.92\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTony Finau: 1.89\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCollin Morikawa: 1.73\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter winning in his first two appearances of the season -- one on the PGA Tour and one on the DP World Tour -- McIlroy disappointed in his stateside debut last week with a T32 finish. Even so, he did gain strokes in every category except for putting. The Phoenix Open is not his preferred scene, and he should enjoy going back to Riviera, where he finished top-10 in three of his last four visits. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePopping up on both lists are Finau (16-1) and Morikawa (20-1), who both have a runner-up here and have been in good form this season.

His company ends up investigating about 1 in every 500 events in which betting is offered. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe legalization of betting and the technology that surrounds it has made these sorts of investigations possible, if not inevitable. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e“There is no anonymous wagering. \u003c/b\u003eThere’s no hiding these bets,” Holt said. “And because that transparency and that heightened level of transparency is there, I do think it’s significantly harder,” Holt said. “We see some people say, ‘\u003cb\u003eOh my goodness, this is what’s wrong with legal sports betting.’ But we on the regulated compliance side say, ‘No, this is what’s right.’\u003c/b\u003e It proves the system is working. If you try to circumvent the rules, we will catch you. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We’re hoping that this big wave of violations will be a deterrent, especially with all of the heightened educational efforts by the professional collegiate sports leagues between their educational efforts and the technological advances allowing us to catch people. We’re hoping both of those will be a deterrent moving forward. And we can get sort of back to a normalcy.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHolt’s basic message to college athletes:\u003cb\u003e “Don’t do it. You will be caught.” \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257877363% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eHere is a Q\u0026A from our conversation. Some questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy have there been so may issues with collegiate sports betting in 2023?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolt\u003c/b\u003e: There’s sort of a journey in states with regulated sports betting. When a new state launches, they have to write regs, get those regs (regulations) passed publicly. Then there’s a licensure process where they have to bulk up these staffs and do background checks and licensing on all these different companies that want to operate sports books. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut 18 to 24 months later, you finish all the licensure background checks, and those temporary licenses become permanent licenses, and your regs are all written, and your laws are your laws. Now you have this great big staff, and what do they do? They can focus on enforcement and identification of issues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat we’re tending to see is in the states where the NFL stuff happened, Colorado, Michigan, Tennessee, and where the college stuff’s happening, Iowa. Those states that have had legal sports betting more than two years. We’re going to see that continue once these states get through the initial two-year licensure regulatory (process). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey’re going to have time to focus on enforcement and using the technological tools available, the U.S. Integrity dashboard and the GeoComply dashboard, which geolocates everyone. When you combine both, they are really strong tools in being able to identify abnormal or suspicious betting patterns, find out who’s doing it, and then go ahead and make the appropriate punitive actions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow did the Alabama baseball case develop in of all places, Ohio? \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolt\u003c/b\u003e: We need to tip our hat to the actual operator who was diligent enough to identify that there was something wrong with the individual patron who was attempting to place those wagers, use the physical surveillance at the facility to gather physical evidence, (and) send the alerts out to us. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe were able to disseminate those alerts in real time to other sportsbook operators and identify people who were involved with the patron attempting to make similar wagers in neighboring states like Indiana. All within a couple hours We’re able to gather all this intel back and in real time. It all started with the diligence of one of the licensed sportsbook operators in Ohio.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(In the Alabama case) we take an alert, anonymize it, disseminated it to every other licensed sportsbook operator in North America, and within hours had responses from people in Indiana saying, ‘Hey, we also had people attempting to place pretty abnormal and suspicious bets on this game as well.’ Come to find out all of those people knew each other (and) were from the same small town. We’re able to connect the dots pretty quickly. And then the Ohio Casino Control Commission did what they did and stepped in and handled the investigation pretty thoroughly, pretty promptly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257877363% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eDo more of these cases come from outside tips or from internal information? \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolt\u003c/b\u003e: It’s us about 70% of the time, and it’s the operators about 30% of the time. In the Alabama case, it was the operator who initially identified the abnormal activity and was able to acquire physical evidence through surveillance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow were the circumstances similar and different in Iowa?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolt\u003c/b\u003e: That used a lot of geolocation. The Department of Criminal Investigations in Iowa (which began sports betting in 2019) noticed that there were logins happening from the stadiums, from the facilities, that just shouldn’t be happening. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnytime you log into a regulated sports betting app, it’s no different than logging into Uber. You’re geolocated to a three-foot radius. They know exactly where you are. First, you’re seeing logins from players, especially collegiate players who aren’t supposed to be betting at all. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey’re coming from an area where there are no fans, no security, no vendors. It’s just the team and coaches practicing. Right away you can start looking into something. Let’s make sure they’re all 21. The other thing that gets a lot of people in trouble is they think they’re being sneaky by having their girlfriend or their mom sign up for the account. \u003cb\u003eBut when it geolocates you to the men’s locker room and it comes up as ‘Mary Smith’ making the bets, well, ‘Mary Smith’ isn’t in the men’s locker room, and now it goes to fraudulently filling out accounts.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eU.S. Integrity has spoken to college athletes in the SEC, Pac 12, Big 12, among others, this year. What is your message?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolt\u003c/b\u003e: Number one, don’t bet using regulated sports betting accounts. You will get caught. If you think that you’re going to not get caught because you’re using your friend’s, or your sister’s, or your girlfriend’s account, you will get caught. Number two, if you’re just trying to check the odds, don’t do it by using regulated sports betting sites. You are instantly geolocated when you log in. The message I always try to say is: ‘You will get caught.’ Do a risk analysis here. Is betting $20 worth your whole collegiate and potentially professional career? No, of course it’s not worth that. It’s hard at the time to realize that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257943453% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow does this extend to ‘inside information’?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolt\u003c/b\u003e: We try to talk to them about when people are approaching you for information through different mechanisms, they’re not doing it out of the kindness of their heart or curiosity. They’re probably doing it to try to get inside information. Most of these kids would never approach the coaches with ‘Hey, I saw these guys gambling in the locker room or logged into betting apps.’ \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e It affects them all. Once investigators start digging into the program, they’re going to dig into everyone. We want to make sure they are aware of safe, anonymous places where they can report this type of activity. We’re not even going to ask for their name. Just provide whatever information you can, because at the end of the day, if you see it, if your teammates are logging in and betting on these apps, they’re putting everyone at risk on the team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow does this vary by state?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolt\u003c/b\u003e: We try to make sure athletes learn the laws or regulations in their state. In some states, it’s actually a felony to place wagers on your own events. You’re not just putting your collegiate career at risk. You can go to jail. What are the laws in your state? What is going to happen when you get caught? Nowadays, if you do this, you’re probably going to get caught. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTechnology is so good, and these phones are all basically tracking devices that when you do this type of activity via your mobile device, the likelihood of someone catching you is very high. Now it’s just a matter of do they want to continue to investigate, prosecute, et cetera, but actually catching the people, is really easy using technology nowadays, if they’re participating in that activity via mobile device.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257877383% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow detailed is the technology?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolt\u003c/b\u003e: Geolocation is the one that we’re seeing recently when we talk about players at the NFL and Iowa and Iowa State.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen someone signs up for a betting account, they give everything their first name, last name, date of birth, social phone number, address, driver’s license. They have to tie it to a bank account or credit card or Venmo or PayPal. There are now all these different ways to track them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIs there is difference in the severity of these cases?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolt\u003c/b\u003e: “The severity of these things ranges dramatically. In the media they all just get lumped in as ‘sports betting violations.’”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There’s a huge difference between the basketball player who bets $20 on Monday night football when he really shouldn’t be betting at all or from a team facility, and the coach who’s trying to manipulate the outcome of a game, or a fighter who’s scripting and predetermining the outcome of a fight, and then trying to profit off that and commit fraudulent activity through regulated betting markets. Those things are really serious. We have to get rid of them. That’s where we really have to clean it up.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat sort of reaction do you get from the college athletes when you talk to them? \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolt\u003c/b\u003e: They don’t realize the extent to which they’re being tracked through their mobile devices. They think that their phone is some little black box in which nobody’s allowed. These regulated apps are tracking you within three feet, in addition to your banking and personal information. That’s the first ‘eyes wide open.’ \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second ‘eyes wide open’ is that gambling is against the law in a lot of these states. It’s hard for people in the industry to keep up with what the laws are in each jurisdiction, never mind student athletes. Using real case studies and athletes they know, like Calvin Ridley. Athletes they may idolize, who they may want to be. Those recent and relevant examples of this is what can happen to you. That also gets their attention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have to keep it relevant. We have to keep it fresh. We have to use real case studies and make sure the information is relevant to them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e Is any of this going to make a difference?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolt\u003c/b\u003e: The educational efforts from all of the collegiate and professional leagues that we’ve seen over the last six to 12 months are going to stop a lot of what we would call the petty violations. The guy betting $20 on a different sport at a place where he is not supposed to do it. Maybe he really didn’t know the rules or wasn’t really aware or didn’t know the ramifications. And now through education, they will, and we’re going to see people not being as a brazen about it or just I think we’ll see people being a lot more conscientious about that type of activity, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257877378% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eResponsible Gambling\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e Always gamble responsibly.

Since then, he moved up to light heavyweight and went 1-2, suffering back-to-back losses to Azamat Murzakanov and Carlos Ulberg (both by knockout).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough Dobson is 0-2 in the UFC, he did have two tough opponents in Armen Petrosyan and Jacob Malkoun. Both Dobson and Nchukwi are there to be hit, and we worry about Nchuwki’s cardio and chin now that he is cutting even more weight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDobson isn’t much of a heavy hitter, but we do think he can out-wrestle Nchuwki and hold him down to win a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eUFC Vegas 78 Best Bet: \u003c/b\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.rotowire.com/mma/player/aj-dobson-2231\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eA.J.

We’re going against the grain in this one and taking the fight to go the distance at plus money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOutside of Luque being finished last time out by Geoff Neal, he has been extremely durable -- the only other time he was finished was in 2013 on the regional scene. Dos Anjos, meanwhile, can also take a punch, as he was finished in the fifth round at 155lbs against Rafael Fiziev, but before that, hadn’t been finished since 2016 -- not bad considering he had fought the likes of Kamaru Usman, Colby Covington, Leon Edwards and Paul Felder.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Luque took a full year off, we expect him to be more patient while dos Anjos will try and wrestle him and control him on the ground.

Inside the Octagon, Buday has proven he has the cardio to go three rounds, and against Parisian, he should be able to wear on him in the clinch to get a decision. Buday has 100% takedown defense, so should be able to keep it standing. On the feet, he is the better striker, and his clinch game will lead to him tiring out Parisian and getting the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other leg is Marcus McGhee taking on JP Buys, who’s 0-3 in the UFC and has been knocked down eight times in three fights. Safe to say we have worries about his chin. McGhee, meanwhile, is a solid striker and also has great takedown defense.

This week’s field is headlined by a trio of co-favorites -- Tony Finau, Sungjae Im and Cameron Young -- at 16-1 odds. Last year, tournament favorite Finau -- at 12-1 -- defeated Im and Emiliano Grillo by three shots and notched his third PGA Tour victory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e2023 3M Open Betting Tips\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCourse Characteristics\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePar 71, 7,431 yards\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eAverage Strokes Gained Rankings: All 3M Open Champions\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSG: Off-the-Tee: \u003cb\u003e29.0\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSG: Approach: \u003cb\u003e7.0\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSG: Around-the-Green: \u003cb\u003e30.8\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSG: Putting: \u003cb\u003e22.0\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSG: Tee-to-Green: \u003cb\u003e11.3\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDriving Distance: \u003cb\u003e23.5\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDriving Accuracy: \u003cb\u003e28.0\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike most courses in this part of the country, water is abundant and comes into play on 13 holes, which can lead to high scores. There are plenty of birdies to be had if you can avoid the wet stuff -- particularly if the wind doesn’t kick up -- and the winning score has ranged from 15- to 21-under-par. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the rough isn’t penal, accuracy off the tee will be important to avoid the water hazards. Approach play looks to be the key statistic, with the winner ranking fourth or better in three of the four years this tournament has been held. We’re looking for players with quality all-around games and also targeting those who fare well in the 150-200 yard range, with a lot of approach shots coming from that distance. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257805393% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMarvelous in Minnesota\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe following five golfers, with a minimum of eight rounds played, have the lowest scoring average at TPC Twin Cities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSungjae Im: 67.5\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTony Finau: 67.7\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEmiliano Grillo: 68.3\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdam Hadwin: 68.5\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdam Long: 68.8\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis will be Im’s third trip to the Twin Cities, and in addition to his T2 last year he finished in a share of 15th in 2019. Following a consistent start to the year in which he posted five top-10s by the beginning of May, Im has failed to record one since. He showed some signs of life at Royal Liverpool with a T20, and he will look to carry the momentum into this week from his perch atop the betting board. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso in a bit of a funk is the defending champion, Finau. Since winning in Mexico at the end of April he has failed to record a top-20, and he enters having missed consecutive cuts for the first time in over two years. Nevertheless, Finau has historically played well in the Midwest and in these lesser events, so this is a great spot for him to get back on track.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257877363% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Proper Approach\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese players, on a per-round basis, gained the most strokes on approach over their last 20 rounds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMark Hubbard: 1.17\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHideki Matsuyama: 1.08\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLucas Glover: 0.96\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eChez Reavie: 0.95\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAaron Rai: 0.87\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eHubbard continues to be one of the best iron players on Tour, ranking 13th in SG: Approach this season. He’s heated up this summer, posting four top-10s over his last seven events. Hubbard finished T16 in his lone appearance here in 2021, and at 55-1, he seems to be slightly overlooked by the oddsmakers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePriced just slightly better at 45-1 is Rai, who will making his first appearance here. His strengths -- driving accuracy and iron play -- should make him a solid course fit. He ranked top-5 in SG: Approach in two of his last four tournaments and notched a top-10 in both. If his irons are true this week, he could contend for his first PGA Tour win.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e2023 3M Open Best Bets\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eOutright Picks\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSepp Straka\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (22-1)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBettors often don’t like taking a golfer who won recently, but we did watch Finau go back-to-back in the Midwest last year. Straka followed up his win at the John Deere Classic with a T2 at The Open, and sometimes you just have to ride the wave. He was second in SG: Approach last week, and we know he’s capable of getting hot and going low. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSahith Theegala\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (45-1)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheegala missed both cuts in Europe -- only his second and third of the season -- and will welcome a return to the United States. While he hasn’t stood out this summer, he still has one of the best short games on Tour and seven top-10s this season. He’s one of the best players among those who have not won and should leave that group soon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLucas Glover\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (45-1)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of going with the hot hand, Glover has stormed to life this month after an uninspiring start to the year. He found something with the flat stick in Detroit and managed his third straight top-10 last week despite losing strokes on the greens. He also has a top-10 in this event.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257877383% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTop-10 Wagers\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eVincent Norrman\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (11-2)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter hitting a top-10 bet with Young last week, I’ll try to keep rolling with Norrman, who picked up his first PGA Tour win two weeks ago at the Barbasol Championship. The 25-year-old rookie is an impressive 13th in Birdie or Better Percentage and sixth in eagles made this season. He has quietly put together seven top-25 finishes over a 13-start span.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePeter Kuest\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (9-1)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 25-year-old’s rise from Monday qualifiers to Special Temporary Membership has been quick and impressive. He posted a top-5 at the Rocket Mortgage Classic earlier this month and already has three top-20s over seven starts. He’s shown excellent length off the tee and is capable of making birdies in bunches.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRyan Gerard\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (12-1)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGerard has notched a couple top-5s, one at another water-filled course in PGA National and the other last week. He’s a solid 67th in SG: Tee-to-Green this season -- not bad for someone who was playing on the PGA Tour Canada at this time last year. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257877378% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHead-To-Head Matchups\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJustin Thomas\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (-120)\u003c/b\u003e over Ludvig Aberg\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe last time we saw Thomas shoot a round in the 80s in a major championship, he bounced back with a top-10 at the Travelers the following week. We should see an extremely motivated JT over the next two weeks, as he is trying to secure spots both in the playoffs and on the Ryder Cup team. Aberg has been strong off the tee but shaky with his wedges and in the short game. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eStephan Jaeger\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (-110)\u003c/b\u003e over Ryan Fox\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFox has been solid but unspectacular thus far -- he has made 9-of-10 cuts but doesn’t have a top-10. He’s also very sporadic off the tee, hitting less than half of fairways, and that could get him into trouble here. Jaeger is also a cut-making machine, having played the weekend in 10 straight starts. He posted a top-10 recently at the Deere. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257805393% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eResponsible Gambling\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e Always gamble responsibly.

Filho was very impressive in his UFC debut despite losing to Muhammad Mokaev by submission late in the fight, as he was arguably winning up until that point. Filho had success with his grappling and nearly forced Mokaev to tap due to a nasty kneebar. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBarez, meanwhile, will be making his UFC debut after winning four straight fights following a loss to Carlos Hernandez on the Contender Series. Barez’s striking defense is a concern, as he is there to be hit, while both Filho and Barez like to wrestle and grapple, which adds some intrigue to this fight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the feet, qw think Filho is the better striker and will be able to land some quality shots. If Filho is on his back, it could be a concern, but he showed off impressive scrambles against Mokaev, which is why we expect him to get out of danger and edge out a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eUFC London Best Bet: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003eJafel Filho\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (-125\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257877363% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWeight Class: Lightweight\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJai Herbert\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (12-4-1) vs. \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003eFares Ziam\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (13-4)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor our underdog, we’re backing Jai Herbert, as we’re surprised he is the underdog. Frankly, we have yet to be sold on Ziam.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough Herbert is 1-1-1 in his last three, his draw should’ve been a win, as we thought he won despite losing a point. Furthermore, his loss came by KO to Ilia Topuria, who will likely be fighting for the featherweight title sooner rather than later. In that fight, Herbert dropped Topuria and nearly finished him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eZiam, meanwhile, is 3-2 in the UFC but has shown he struggles on the ground, as Terrance McKinney was able to quickly submit him. Although Herbert isn’t known for his grappling and wrestling, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see him take it there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe expect this fight to play out primarily on the feet. To me, Herbert is the better striker with more power. This is a coin flip type of fight, so to get plus-money on Herbert -- who also has the grappling edge -- makes this a play for us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eUFC London Best Bet: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003eJai Herbert\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (+135\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257877378% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWeight Classes: Women’s Flyweight\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly McCann\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (13-5) vs. \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003eJulija Stoliarenko\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (10-7-1)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, Julija Stoliarenko is moving down to flyweight after fainting on the scales when she tried to make 135 lbs. We think there is a good chance this fight doesn’t happen, as Stoliarenko might miss weight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, if it does happen, we really like Molly McCann to get a stoppage win here, as Stoliarenko will be depleted from the weight cut and already hasn’t been the most durable fighter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStoliarenko is 1-5 in the UFC and is coming off a first-round TKO loss to Chelsea Chandler. McCann meanwhile, has finished her last two wins and she has a ton of power for flyweight. Although we think McCann gets a TKO win, we’ll play it safe and take McCann by inside the distance here, as we don’t trust Stoliarenko’s weight cut or durability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eUFC London Best Bet: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly McCann\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e to win inside the distance (+130\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:266042956% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWeight Class: Heavyweight and Featherweight\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eTom Aspinall\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (12-3) vs. \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003eMarcin Tybura\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (24-7)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eNathaniel Wood\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (19-5) vs. \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003eAndre Fili\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e (22-9)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor our parlay, we’re backing Tom Aspinall to beat Marcin Tybura in the main event, as well as Nathaniel Wood to beat Andre Fili at featherweight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAspinall is coming off a major knee injury last July and is now set for a favorable matchup against Tybura. Tybura is a grinder who will look to push Aspinall up against the fence and try and grind out a decision. However, Aspinall has solid grappling, so we expect him to keep it standing. In the second or third round he’ll land heavy shots to get a TKO win.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other leg is Nathaniel Wood looking to build off of his 2-0 featherweight run, as he previously defeated Charles Jourdain and Charles Rosa. Wood is one of the top prospects in the sport, and he gets a big name fight against Fili, who has struggled as of late (1-2 with one No Contest in his last four). We expect Wood to use his wrestling to get Fili on the ground, and on the feet, the Brit is more active, which is why we like him to win a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eUFC London Best Bets: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003eTom Aspinall\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u0026 \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003eNathaniel Wood\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e parlay (-119\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257877383% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eResponsible Gambling\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e Always gamble responsibly.

After finishing T12 in his debut, he faded in the final pairing last year to ultimately finish tied for fourth. He bounced back from a disappointing result at the PGA Championship to win the Memorial two weeks later and looks close to picking up a major trophy in short order. Also faring well in this event is Finau, who has finished no worse than T28 over eight Open appearances, with a solo third in 2019. Something will have to give between that and his recent play, as he has failed to record a top-20 in six starts since winning the Mexico Open. At 60-1 odds, it’s difficult to find a better long shot with a reasonable chance to pull off the win.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- %asset:257805393% --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eDialed In From Distance\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe following golfers, on a per-round basis, gained the most strokes off the tee and on approach combined over their last 20 rounds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eScottie Scheffler: 3.03\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRory McIlroy: 2.07\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJon Rahm: 1.67\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCollin Morikawa: 1.56\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatrick Cantlay: 1.51\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’ve been fading Scheffler expecting his run of extraordinary play to come to an end, you’ve been left waiting for quite some time, as he extended his streak of top-5 finishes to seven at last week’s Genesis Scottish Open. He has looked comfortable in his brief experience on links courses, finishing T8 and T21 in his two Open Championship appearances. The only player to appear on both lists is McIlroy, and among the majors, he seems to like the Open setups the best, notching six top-5 results. Coming off a win last week and a win the last time this event was held here, expectations are high as he tries to finally break his nine-year drought without a major.
