job = "Senior Product Manager"
bio = "I’m driven by innovation and I believe we can change the media industry with solutions that really matter to a consumer that is changing as fast as technology evolves. At MCclatchy, I look after revenue products at all levels of the proverbial funnel from advertising to subscriptions, including on- and off-platform environments. As a journalist and a communicator at heart, I look at content and audience as my guiding lights. I live in Washington, DC now but I really feel like a world citizen."
