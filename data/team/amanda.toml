job = "Senior Product Manager"
bio = "I am a nerd for content management systems, newsletters and just about any other tool that helps journalists reach their audiences. I worked in newsrooms for two decades, which means in addition to having a lot of knowledge about newsroom systems and workflow, I also swear too much and consume too much caffeine. In my spare time, I root for the Kansas City Chiefs, Kansas City Royals and Liverpool FC; and I make it my mission to find and consume all the good craft beer I can."
