bio = "I lead a talented group of PMs, researchers, and designers dedicated to building products that meet our readers’ needs. My day-to-day includes project management, analyzing data, setting KPIs for new features, conducting user research, and product roadmap wrangling. I love answering three questions: “Should we do this?” “How should we do this?” and “Should we keep doing this?” Outside of work, I love painting, throwing dinner parties, kickboxing and (admiring) great furniture design."
