bio = "I plan a/b tests to prove that proposed improvements to our sites are beneficial.  Whether successful or not, we learn from the results and can integrate our findings into our product strategy.  I get to be part of the group, which discusses strategies and suggests learnings that could help predict the success of our new products.  When I have time, I enjoy taekwondo, training reptiles, reading, and searching for Cadbury Eggs."
