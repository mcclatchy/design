job = "Technical Product Manager, Subscriptions"
bio = "I own the subscription strategy and roadmap for our on and off platform subscription products. I’m a journalism outsider and come to McClatchy from a tech startup background, but I’ve always admired the essential work that our journalists produce. I work collaboratively with architects, developers, product owners, and anyone else who wants to provide a subscription experience that is worthy of our world-class journalism. Outside of work I enjoy yelling at ACC referees, camping, and listening to classic country music."
