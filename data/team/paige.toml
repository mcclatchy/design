bio = "I use empathy to create thoughtful and engaging visuals and designs for marketing campaigns. I create processes to facilitate production of assets across our markets, from dynamic and customizable email designs, animations and print and digital creatives. I love collaborating with colleagues and devising fantastic ideas and strategies. I have two rambunctious boys and a small yappy dog – when I’m not serving as referee between the three, I strive to find inner peace with a cup of coffee."
