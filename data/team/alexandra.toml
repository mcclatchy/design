job = "Product Manager and Designer"
bio = "I create marketing email and ad designs, write HTML for emails (without going insane) and work on UX design and some HTML/CSS for our websites. I'm our resident hardcore journalism geek and enjoy bringing a journalist's perspective into design, because I think it's important to always remember what we are designing for. I also love to foster shelter kittens, dye my hair random colors and watch too much prestige TV."
