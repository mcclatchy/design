bio = "I'm the team's email design expert. I manage our email design system and ensure everything looks great and renders perfectly. I'm a bit of a journalism geek, and that background helps shape my design decisions and motivates me every day. In my spare time, I foster kittens, obsess over TV, dye my hair random colors and bake sweet treats for family and friends."
