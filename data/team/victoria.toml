name = "Victoria Martinez"
job = "Consumer Experience Content Strategist"
bio = "I’m a stickler for grammar, the written word, and obsessive about typography. New to the team, but have worked in the media and broadcast industry for almost two decades. I’ve done a little of everything from video production, agency life, sports journalism, and previously the Nightlife Editor for Miami.com. When I’m not working, I’m an obsessed dog mom, ridiculously hyper-active (no, I don’t drink coffee unless it’s iced), and a Momager to my son who has played competitive soccer for 15 years. Catch me on the sidelines of every game on the weekends. That’s me in a nutshell."
