bio = "A journalism nerd since a young age, I learned to read using headlines in my local newspapers. In fourth grade, I started a class paper, which broke the news of two boys cutting class in its debut edition. As a grown-up, I’ve always been drawn to new ways we can leverage technology to engage the communities we serve. Now I work with newsrooms and marketers on approaches to deepen our relationships with readers. When I’m not online, I dabble in crafts and enjoy cooking with my toddler."
