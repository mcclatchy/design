bio = "I set the direction and plan the development work for our front end and performance dev teams. Together, we build cool things to support journalists (and editors, users, advertisers, marketers…). I enjoy sitting at the intersection between software and journalism, and collaborating between different groups to figure out the best things to build and the best way to build them. Outside of work, I play tennis and soccer and lots of complicated board games about dwarves."
