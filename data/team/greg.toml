bio = "I’ve been around the newspaper/media business since I was a little kid stuffing advertising inserts into the community newspaper my dad still works at. Having been everything from a Publisher at a group of community weeklies, to an Assistant Managing Editor at a large metro to a designer and graphic artist, I’ve always been the type of person who wants to make a better user experience for our readers. I love pulling people together to fix problems and improve our products.  I see my current role as helping to keep our projects moving forward and organized. And I’m always trying to answer the eternal question, “What are we missing?”"
