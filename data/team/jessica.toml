bio = "My role is to advocate for the importance of design in strategic decision making and to clear paths for the design team to build beautiful, meaningful and intentional products. I’m known for my dislike of notched objects in type, lazy carousels, italicized articles in headlines and useless decoration. You can often hear me uttering the words, “Who is this for” or “It looks tacked on” or “Am I reaching for the stars here?""
