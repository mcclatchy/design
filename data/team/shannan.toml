bio = "I obsess over our audience funnel, from how to attract diverse groups of audiences to how to show the value of our journalism so that they subscribe and keep subscribing. I approach audience development through a product strategy lens, focusing on personalized user journeys that meet specific audience needs while building our subscription business at the same time. Outside of work, I’m a busy mom to two little humans and a dog and love living in North Carolina."
