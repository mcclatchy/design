As a result, Missouri now ranks third in the nation for election integrity and is a model for other states,” spokesperson Jason Cabel Roe said in an email, citing a report from the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based conservative think tank.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Jay has demonstrated a willingness to listen to all Missourians and will always take a fact-based approach to investigating election irregularities.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAshcroft, a Republican, is running for governor in 2024.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMonday’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article277842363.html\"\u003eindictment against the former president\u003c/a\u003e offers an interesting case study for Ashcroft, who is in charge of running Missouri’s elections. Ashcroft holds the same office as Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who Trump allegedly \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article277842363.html\"\u003eattempted to pressure to overturn the election results in Georgia\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe statement from Ashcroft’s team illustrates how the Republican is walking a fine line between not supporting the former president’s actions while also refusing to criticize Trump, who is now facing his fourth indictment as he mounts another campaign for the White House.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpokespeople for Missouri Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican who is running for governor against Ashcroft, did not respond to questions asking whether Kehoe would have resisted Trump’s demands. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn contrast to Ashcroft and Kehoe, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, strongly applauded the way Georgia officials handled Trump’s pressure campaign that followed the election. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I do think they handled it appropriately, they were doing their job,” Kelly said. “So yeah, if something like this were to happen in Kansas I would hope that our election officials would do likewise.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a separate statement from Ashcroft’s official office, spokesperson JoDonn Chaney touted Missouri’s “safe and accurate elections.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Secretary Ashcroft took an oath to follow the constitution, which he takes very seriously,” Chaney said. “He abides by Missouri statute and will continue to do so in all circumstances.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, Ashcroft has taken steps that critics argue have elevated debunked claims of election fraud. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn January, The Star \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article270827147.html\"\u003erevealed that Ashcroft met with right-wing conspiracy theorist and MyPillow founder Mike Lindell\u003c/a\u003e in Jefferson City. Lindell played a major role in promoting baseless lies about the 2020 election and has continued to elevate claims in the years that have followed. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the months following the November 2020 vote, Trump attempted to push officials in Georgia, including Raffensperger, to overturn their official vote counts. The Republican resisted the former president. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a 2021 \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article277842363.html\"\u003etelephone conversation\u003c/a\u003e, Trump pushed Raffensperger to overturn the state’s election results by finding enough votes to declare him the victor. This act led Fani Willis, the district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, to charge Trump with felony charges for soliciting a violation of oath by a public officer and making false statements and writings. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“What I want to do is this,” Trump said in the phone call. “I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAshcroft’s stance on the indictment is on par with his decisions as secretary of state. Following Trump’s debunked theories after the 2020 presidential election, Ashcroft said he was confident that Missouri’s elections were secure. But, at the same time, the Republican has taken an approach that some say \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article274207115.html\"\u003esupports unproven claims about the elections in which he runs\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn April, The Guardian reported that Ashcroft was among 10 state election officials who \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/05/heritage-foundation-election-voting-rights-republican-states\"\u003eattended a secret February conference\u003c/a\u003e held by three groups that spread election denial lies and advocate for stricter voting laws.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKehoe’s unwillingness to weigh in on the indictment comes as Georgia’s former lieutenant governor was a witness against the former president in the Georgia election case. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump on Monday went on his social media site Truth Social and said Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a Republican who served from 2019 to January 2023, should not testify. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Republicans should never let honesty be mistaken for weakness,” Duncan posted Saturday on the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, confirming that he had been called to testify. Current Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, also a Republican, is listed as one of nearly three dozen unindicted co-conspirators in the indictment against Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Monday’s indictment, Missouri Republicans, who typically have been quick to defend the former president and have painted his previous charges as politically-motivated, were largely silent. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMissouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, one of the few officials to weigh in on social media, attempted to paint the indictment as a First Amendment violation, using the charges to promote the \u003ca href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article277459998.html\"\u003estate’s lawsuit\u003c/a\u003e alleging that the White House violated the First Amendment by working with social media companies to suppress conservative speech.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Leftists seriously just indicted President Trump for tweeting and Mark Meadows for texting. This is precisely why Missouri is taking Joe Biden to task over his censorship regime,” Bailey posted, referring to Trump’s former chief of staff who was also indicted. “If the First Amendment goes, it all goes.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMissouri Republican Sens. Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt, both ardent Trump supporters, did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday and neither posted about the indictment on social media. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, just hours before the indictment, Schmitt posted photographs on social media at the Iowa State Fair with Trump supporters and Matthew Whitaker, who was acting U.S. attorney general under Trump. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“In Iowa. For Trump. For America,” Schmitt posted. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Star’s Katie Bernard contributed to this report. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

He said the paper’s “negative” coverage can be a sore spot with residents and businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat could be because the Record — which is led by Meyer, who worked for 16 years at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, and whose staff includes a former Wichita Eagle reporter — covers a small community that has had its share of controversy even before the raid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast year, for example, the town’s two top cops and a city clerk, who was married to the then-police chief, all resigned, apparently over the lack of discipline against a city administrator accused of misconduct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe administrator allegedly showed a “provocative” photograph of the owner of Dawn’s Day Spa — who had worked as a model — to the city treasurer, Meyer said.
