My first project was to design a feature that would display nutritional information across the Tasty website and app. On my second day of work, I quickly understood how highly requested of a feature it was: I was sifting through a couple hundred relevant support tickets to better understand our users‚Äô needs. Additionally, I researched popular diets and dietary restrictions to learn more about what was most important to show. After sharing my concepts with my mentor during check-ins, the rest of the design team in critique meetings, and Tasty product managers, I finalized designs so it could be built in the¬†future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZhC6cZGs-FH2wXF1sgi3-g.jpeg\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eMy design sprint squad scrambling to fill up their boxes during our \u003ca href=\"https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methods/sketch/crazy-8s/\"\u003ecrazy 8‚Äôs activity\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy second project was focused on creating a new ‚Äúlean-back‚Äù experience for Tasty users who want to predominantly consume video content. The goals were to increase view count and offer a more seamless transition from one recipe page to another. We wanted to do this by creating an entertainment-centric way to watch our videos, as most of our viewership stems from Facebook and Instagram sources.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first week, I started off the project by catching up on our internal research relating to videos. I also created a slide-deck that detailed my analyses on popular video trends across recipe platforms, entertainment hubs, social media networks, and news outlets. Then, I planned and hosted my very own internal design sprint comprised of seven participants: designers, engineers, a data scientist, and a product manager across various teams at BuzzFeed. I brought in donuts to try and compensate for their generous donation of an hour and half of their¬†workday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI ended up grabbing some great ideas from the sprint and then spent some time sketching explorations on my own. After finalizing on four concepts to test, I set up video calls with Tasty users to conduct research studies. It was my first time, so I was pretty nervous, but I ended up having so much fun with all my interactions. In addition to the comments they provided on the prototypes, users didn‚Äôt hold back from telling me how much they loved Tasty. One user mentioned how much his granddaughter enjoyed making our desserts, and another mentioned how she and her husband cook our recipes together (\u003cem\u003eaw\u003c/em\u003e).

On Mondays, senior designers host ‚ÄúStudy Hall,‚Äù similar to office hours for design. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, we engage in critique meetings where we share our work for a combined six hours. On every other Friday, we host Design Club where a designer comes into the office for an hour to share his or her journey. I always left the talks super inspired‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsimilar to the feeling I get when I finish watching TED videos that make me question my collective life choices.

I learned that it‚Äôs important to continuously ask for feedback no matter what phase of the design process you‚Äôre in, to involve product managers‚Äô and engineers‚Äô judgements as early as you can, and that design processes can differ contrastingly from project to project.

We make a spreadsheet with every skill from the role document listed, and ask each designer to indicate what level they think they‚Äôre at for each skill based on the existing documentation. Separately, their manager also fills out a duplicate spreadsheet about that designer from their perspective. And then, the designer and manager get together and compare their results side-by-side.

Or we covered running quantitative experiments, but it turned out a lot of designers were running their own qualitative studies (and we just hired our first full-time User Researcher!).

So, let‚Äôs get a little technical and talk about our general approach for creating an AutoComplete provider in Atom. Unfortunately, getting Solid into an autocomplete ‚Äúprovider‚Äù isn‚Äôt necessarily trivial, so here‚Äôs a few things that I did to make it easier along the way. I‚Äôm not going to go into too much detail here, but feel free poke around and clone the repo at \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/buzzfeed/solid-completions\"\u003egithub.com/buzzfeed/solid-completions\u003c/a\u003e to help make your own autocomplete provider based on your frameworks and preferences. If you‚Äôre still scratching your head, don‚Äôt hesitate to \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/mshuster\"\u003eget in¬†touch\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, I‚Äôd recommend getting a little more familiar with the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/wiki/Provider-API\"\u003eAtom autocomplete provider API docs on GitHub\u003c/a\u003e. You‚Äôll notice that Atom plugins are written in \u003ca href=\"http://coffeescript.org/\"\u003eCoffeeScript\u003c/a\u003e. CoffeeScript compiles to JavaScript, so it‚Äôs totally acceptable to write plugins in JavaScript if it‚Äôs more your¬†speed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen you‚Äôll need to structure the data that you want your provider to serve. We did this by analyzing our SCSS and CSS files with \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss\"\u003ePostCSS\u003c/a\u003e. PostCSS is a stylesheet post-processor that‚Äôs commonly used to manipulate CSS after it has already passed through preprocessors like Sass and has been rendered into CSS. It‚Äôs incredibly powerful, but we like it because it constructs a walkable AST (abstract syntax tree) in JSON that you can use to extract all the rules in your CSS or Sass that you would like to serve as autocomplete phrases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou‚Äôll then have to define the scope to determine when the autocomplete provider will be serving suggestions to the user. For classes in an HTML document, your scope would look something like:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cpre\u003e.html .meta.tag.any .string.quoted\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, be aware that this will trigger autocomplete on any attribute that has a value in quotes. To make sure you‚Äôre only triggering on class attributes, you‚Äôll have to take a look at the current line your editor buffer and walk back to the nearest attribute.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, when you build your array of suggestions, make use of the various properties in the suggestion object to include hints to the user about what the keyword does and how to use it. Our solution shows the Solid framework logo, along with a label indicating what the function of the class does. We also include a link to the relevant documentation for that class within the description field.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eGet Friendly With Your Fellow Designers and Developers\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDesigning in code means one less level of abstraction for passing design artifacts between ‚Äúdesigners‚Äù and ‚Äúdevelopers.‚Äù Having both sides of the spectrum work with the same tools creates many efficiencies, but \u003cstrong\u003ethere is also a big opportunity to build our own processes and workflows into extensible tools like Atom\u003c/strong\u003e to allow for even greater learning, cooperation, and standardization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*d3TKqTryuYpNCh5MIQ3PEg.gif\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed\u0026referrerSource=full_rss\u0026postId=d2b0035cf62d\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/buzzfeed-design/design-tooling-with-solid-atom-or-making-the-ide-our-bff-d2b0035cf62d\"\u003eDesign Tooling With Solid \u0026amp; Atom (or, making the IDE our BFF)\u003c/a\u003e was originally published in \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/buzzfeed-design\"\u003eBuzzFeed Design\u003c/a\u003e on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.\u003c/p\u003e","link":"https://medium.com/buzzfeed-design/design-tooling-with-solid-atom-or-making-the-ide-our-bff-d2b0035cf62d?source=rss----60b3a6f3294f---4","published":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 15:00:15 GMT","publishedParsed":"2016-04-19T15:00:15Z","author":{"name":"Mark Shuster"},"guid":"https://medium.com/p/d2b0035cf62d","categories":["buzzfeed","atom","design"],"dcExt":{"creator":["Mark Shuster"]},"extensions":{"atom":{"updated":[{"name":"updated","value":"2016-04-19T15:35:15.701Z","attrs":{},"children":{}}]},"dc":{"creator":[{"name":"creator","value":"Mark Shuster","attrs":{},"children":{}}]}}},{"title":"BuzzFeed Product Design Roles 2.0","content":"\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6NLdG6B7L-rCGXwySgaILA.gif\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003ePhoto by \u003ca href=\"https://www.stocksy.com/34135\"\u003eDeirdre Malfatto\u003c/a\u003e; illustration by \u003ca href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/shaunpendy\"\u003eShaun Pendergast/BuzzFeed\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn spring of 2015, I \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@niederme/a-farewell-to-the-times-32013afef8cc#.6p3hs4gip\"\u003eleft a job I loved\u003c/a\u003e to become a design manager at BuzzFeed, excited to tackle new challenges in a new organization.

For example in Solid the class ‚Äú.xs-p1‚Äù will give you one unit of padding. Atomic class libraries give you a suite of these classes. You can combine them to tweak elements or style them from the ground up. Here is an example of an element styled with Solid‚Äôs atomic¬†classes:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u0026lt;div class=‚Äùxs-border xs-p1\u0026quot;\u0026gt;10 top thought leaders\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I first saw a string of code like that it terrified me.

Prior to that, we had unintentionally built silos around the two disciplines. While we‚Äôre definitely proud of the end result, this new way of working came with some interesting challenges and lessons along the way. We know there are a lot of teams out there who are curious about bringing their engineers and designers closer together, so we thought we‚Äôd share a bit about what we encountered and what we‚Äôve come away with after nearly a year of working closely together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*DK3uHrwzhmVnlh2R0D731Q.gif\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://giphy.com/gifs/power-rangers-break-teamwork-5Ymi5wNuK6cne\"\u003ehttp://giphy.com/gifs/power-rangers-break-teamwork-5Ymi5wNuK6cne\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProcess Rules\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we started the project, we were pretty stoked about the idea. We were finally going to have a style guide! CSS would finally be simpler to work with! With all our excitement, it would have been pretty easy to just start building things without much regard for process or how we‚Äôd work together. We needed some sort of process to help us align our team and avoid a messy codebase. However, we also recognized that adding too much process too early can snuff out the energy and momentum before you‚Äôve gotten anywhere. If we were going to be successful, we needed just the right amount of process and just the right amount of¬†freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/495/0*XdE7Y332-FhZujgK.\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/gZEBpuOkPuydi/giphy.gif\"\u003ehttps://media.giphy.com/media/gZEBpuOkPuydi/giphy.gif\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo start, we decided to meet weekly, giving us a way to maintain momentum and have a regular forum for in-person discussion. After a few philosophical discussions in person and on Slack about how to structure our style guide and write the CSS (we had a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of philosophical discussions throughout this process), we drew up an initial list of the elements we thought we might need. From there, we tackled one or two UI pieces at a time, starting with inventories of current implementations and new design explorations before moving on to actually writing them into the Solid codebase.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/660/0*rmaZ6HP4BXUVZxG-.\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe sort of had a lot of button¬†styles‚Ä¶\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCollaboration Is¬†Key\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor each UI element inventory and explanation, we asked everyone to weigh in on the best, consistent solution. We used Basecamp (a staple on the design team) to share our work and explorations regularly and solicit feedback from across the entire product team. Even though the style guide group itself was small, we wanted to craft the core BuzzFeed styles with as many perspectives as possible. After all, these styles were going to belong to all of¬†us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough a couple of our designers were already strong front-ends, we also decided to pair engineers with designers who had less front-end experience to write Solid‚Äôs code. Surely it wasn‚Äôt the fastest route, but it ensured a more well-rounded style guide team, taught designers how to write front-end and began to break down those old barriers between design and engineering.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/0*DgLLpKYfLu5el0mW.\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://giphy.com/gifs/13zTeMM9tzvNL2\"\u003ehttp://giphy.com/gifs/13zTeMM9tzvNL2\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuild, Break,¬†Change\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce we‚Äôd implemented our first couple UI elements, things began moving pretty quickly. Soon enough we had a somewhat working style guide that we could actually build things with! And, of course, the Solid team immediately started building small prototypes with our shiny new CSS. We didn‚Äôt have to focus on crafting the perfect button any longer. Now we could focus on more important problems like user experience and information architecture. We were thrilled to be able to easily demonstrate an idea with code, whereas before most of us had been living in a world of static¬†mocks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/426/0*dIPIHaxxmD9pl4O2.\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://giphy.com/gifs/happy-excited-the-office-nGzeO4uSxRUcg\"\u003ehttp://giphy.com/gifs/happy-excited-the-office-nGzeO4uSxRUcg\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we started to share these prototypes as part of our normal design process, other designers wanted in too. We knew that the sooner we got people using it in their work, the sooner we‚Äôd discover things we missed, things we could kill, and what documentation was unclear. So, the Solid team helped designers get the local environment running on their machines. We used our public Slack channel as a way to answer questions from those using it and as a venue for collecting feedback. It soon became clear we needed a way to track issues, so we started to use Jira to manage our tasks and bugs. Things were really happening!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter using it ourselves and receiving feedback from the designers testing it, it became clear what was great and what needed more work. Our small team was able to iterate quickly. We changed class names when we realized they were confusing; we reorganized the navigation when it was hard to find things. And because our changes only impacted some small design prototypes, it was fairly painless to make sweeping changes when we realized we‚Äôd gone down the wrong path. Now, even though Solid is far more stable and being used in quite a few production environments at BuzzFeed, we still continue to evolve the code and documentation, knowing that as our needs change, our style guide has to change with¬†it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/0*mewRnjL3_gtifmCM.\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://giphy.com/gifs/what-university-research-eXO8X3Oz90jPG\"\u003ehttp://giphy.com/gifs/what-university-research-eXO8X3Oz90jPG\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompromises can make or break your¬†team\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the entire process, it wasn‚Äôt all rainbows and pumpkin spice lattes. To be honest, we‚Äôd regularly find ourselves in various disagreements. For instance, we didn‚Äôt always agree on how to structure the CSS. Should we use BEM or not? We discussed this issue countless times, and it‚Äôs something we are still struggling with today. We were all passionate and opinionated (and still are!), but we listened to each other and tried to arrive at most sensible product decision. We stayed focused by making the decision that made the most sense for us at the time. If we didn‚Äôt have a use case for it yet, we didn‚Äôt worry about it.

First, we gave a talk to the entire Tech team during our weekly Tech Talks series. We talked about why we thought Solid was important, how it was built and gave a quick demo of building a piece of UI with the framework. People were wowed and it felt really good to see the entire organization start to get¬†excited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbout a month later, we held our first annual BuzzFeed Hack Week. We asked people to use Solid in their Hack Week projects while it was still in beta and then requested feedback after Hack Week was over. We were betting that if people found it made their lives easier, we‚Äôd gain even more momentum. We collected some valuable feedback over the course of Hack Week, but all in all, people were excited to have a framework that was easy to use. They‚Äôre hacks went a lot faster (and looked a lot better), and afterward we had a lot of folks clamoring for Solid to hit 1.0 so they could get it into our production environments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe process continues\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Solid team still meets on a weekly basis, though the size of the group has decreased now that the guts of the product have been built.
