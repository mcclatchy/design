# Our Team

McClatchy’s ProductX Team is a group of cross-disciplinary rock stars who work together to build user-centered digital products across McClatchy. This team collaborates together on news, product, UX and marketing projects. As designers, UX researchers and front-end developers, the group created the first design system for McClatchy and continues to enhance storytelling in local newsrooms through immersive design. Only 2 years in existence, the group has redesigned all products and continues to iterate based on user needs. This includes leading design strategy on websites, apps, and newsletters, to name a few.
