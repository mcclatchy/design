# Our Team

The Product Experience Team is a group of multi-disciplinary creative professionals who work collaboratively to build user-centered digital products in McClatchy. "ProdX" works on news, product, UX and marketing projects. As designers, writers, UX researchers and front-end developers, ProdX created McClatchy's first design system and continues to craft story-telling in newsrooms through immersive, interactive design and data visualization. The group has redesigned all products and continues to iterate based on user needs; this includes leading product strategy on websites, apps, and newsletters, to highlight a few.
