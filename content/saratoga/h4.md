title: h4
description: Used as footer labels.
menu: atom

---
Default browser spacing for the `<h4>` atom should be used unless specifically set at the molecule or organism level. Doing so reduces bloat, given that this atom is used in a couple different scenarios, and allows for cascading to apply properly at that level.

#### Example
<h4 class="serif" style="text-transform: none;">Jayhawks back in town, start practicing for Saturdayâ€™s Eastern Michigan game</h4>

#### CSS
```css
h4, .h4 {
  font: 400 16px/1.2em "McClatchy Serif", serif;
}
```
