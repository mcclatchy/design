title: "<h4>"
description: "Used as footer labels on all pages. Can also be used in a story."
level: "atom"
---

Default browser spacing for the `<h4>` atom should be used unless specifically set at the molecule or organism level. Doing so reduces bloat, given that this atom is used in a couple different scenarios, and allows for cascading to apply properly at that level.

#### Example
<div class="example">
  <h4>Jayhawks back in town, start practicing for Saturdayâ€™s Eastern Michigan game</h4>
</div>

#### CSS
```css
h4 {
  font: 400 16px/1.2em "McClatchy Serif", serif;
}
```
