The expander is a simple molecule to toggle the visibility of it's siblings. The element itself acts as the toggle by swapping the open class. This can be done a number of ways, but to keep things simple for the demo we used the `onclick` attribute directly.

The generic rules make for a very flexible setup, where we can force each child to display in all cases inline or with additional CSS in the future.

#### Example
{{< series-nav >}}

#### HTML
{{< highlight html >}}{{< series-nav >}}{{< /highlight >}}
