The footer should go on at the bottom of all pages. In keeping with the changes in 1.11.3, raw SVG code is used in lieu of CSS classes. This allows us to use the same code in AMP for these elements as our regular stories.

#### EXAMPLE

*The footer is included in all of our decks, and is better represented there.* 

*For an example, go to our [story deck](../decks/story/).*

#### HTML
{{< highlight html >}}
{{< footer >}}
{{< /highlight >}}
