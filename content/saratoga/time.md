Timestamps are always displayed on their own line, so `<time>` is converted to a block level element by default.

#### EXAMPLE
<div class="example">
  <time>DECEMBER 27, 2018 01:27 PM</time>
</div>

#### CSS
```css
time {
  display: block;
  font: 300 11px/1.2em "McClatchy Sans", sans-serif;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  color: #989898;
}
```
