The sponsor card is a simple grid and package combination, with some differences to the image dimensions. The sponsoring group should provide a square image, and newsrooms should use the free crop to ensure all of the logo is showing.

#### Example
{{< sponsor >}}

#### HTML
{{< highlight html >}}{{< sponsor >}}{{< /highlight >}}
