#### Example

#### EXAMPLE

# Jayhawks back in town, start practicing for Saturday’s Eastern Michigan game

## Additional rules
This headline style indicates the most important content on the page (when big news or immersive template is not applied). This style should be used sparingly to establish and maintain hierarchy across all pages in the design system. E.g., on the homepage, this style is only used twice–on the featured story and in-depth card. On section fronts, it is used up to three times–page title, featured story and in-depth card (if used).
