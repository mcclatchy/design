Default browser spacing for the `<h1>` atom should be used unless specifically set at the molecule or organism level. Doing so reduces bloat, given that this atom is used in many scenarios, and allows for cascading to apply properly at that level.

#### Example
<div class="example">
  <h1>Jayhawks back in town, start practicing for Saturday’s Eastern Michigan game</h1>
</div>

#### CSS
```css
h1, .h1 {
  font: 600 30px/1.2em "McClatchy Serif", serif;
}
```

#### Additional rules
This headline style indicates the most important content on the page (when big news or immersive template is not applied). This style should be used sparingly to establish and maintain hierarchy across all pages in the design system. E.g., on the homepage, this style is only used twice–on the featured story and in-depth card. On section fronts, it is used up to three times–page title, featured story and in-depth card (if used).
