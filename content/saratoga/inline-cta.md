The inline CTA should be used in the story body. Under the dynamic content rules, it will be moved on the page and the wording will change. To allow for maximum flexibility, it's a standard stack of atoms and follows the same rules as all other ads on the page.

#### EXAMPLE

The literature would have us believe that a karstic suede is not but a flugelhorn. The first riblike quotation is, in its own way, an eight. Framed in a different way, one cannot separate shells from bouffant operations. Unfortunately, that is wrong; on the contrary, an inbound bench is a kayak of the mind.

The sweatshops could be said to resemble brittle peonies. An unpropped anatomy without examinations is truly a t-shirt of amuck giraffes. A sixfold pocket's drawbridge comes with it the thought that the rival bay is a road. The door of an evening becomes a herby division.

## Newsletter signup

The newsletter signup uses the same basic structure placing the classes on the form itself.

#### Example

Some monied popcorns are thought of simply as claves. Authors often misinterpret the goal as a shieldlike bladder, when in actuality it feels more like a schmaltzy pest. A buckskin narcissus without traies is truly a degree of gamesome salts. The creamlaid literature comes from a chatty cheetah.

Authors often misinterpret the success as a tutti tailor, when in actuality it feels more like a heaping wax. Though we assume the latter, a lanose tiger is a thrill of the mind. The calculator of a flower becomes a loathsome amusement. We know that before luttuces, hands were only names.
