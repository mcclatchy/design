Default browser spacing for the `<h3>` atom should be used unless specifically set at the molecule or organism level. Doing so reduces bloat, given that this atom is used in many scenarios, and allows for cascading to apply properly at that level.

#### Example
<div>
  <h3>Jayhawks back in town, start practicing for Saturdayâ€™s Eastern Michigan game</h3>
</div>

#### CSS
```css
h3, .h3 {
  font: 400 18px/1.2em "McClatchy Serif", serif;
