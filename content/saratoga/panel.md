The panel card is a more generic form of the transparency card. It was originally made for the labs section pages, and its use grew from there. It can be used on section pages, or in story pages if the wrapping embed-infographic has the full-bleed class placed on it with javascript.

#### EXAMPLE

{{< panel >}}
