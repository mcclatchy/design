    <p>The premium theme is designed for enterprise content. It performs a number of enhancements common to these types of projects:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It widens landscape photos and videos</li>
      <li>It removes content between the story and the footer</li>
      <li>It fixes Series Nav links when published to multiple markets</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to these changes, the theme also addresses zones and introduces a concept we call valid insertion points. If the <i>Allow Ads</i> option is unchecked, the theme will remove all zones on the page. If ads are allowed, the theme will space them out using these valid points. First, the theme pulls the zones out of the page and stores them. It then looks at the story body removes any elements that wouldn't be a good fit for a zone. The rules for valid points are:</p>

    <div class="zone">
      <fake-ad size="[728,400]"></fake-ad>
    </div>

    <ol class="code">
      <li>The element must be a paragraph</li>
      <li>The text of the paragraph must be more than 100 characters</li>
      <li>The previous element must also be a paragraph</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Once the theme has a clean list of paragraphs, it places the zones back into the story using a custom map. The map for this theme is listed below, and please use our <a href="../../decks/story/">story deck</a> for reference. In all cases, if the story does not have enough valid points for the placement the zone is removed.</p>

    <div class="zone grid combo">
      <fake-ad style="--color: gray"></fake-ad>
      <fake-ad></fake-ad>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li>Zone 2 is removed entirely</li>
      <li>Zone 3 is moved to the 6th point</li>
      <li>Zone 4 is moved to the 12th point</li>
      <li>Zone 5 is moved to the 18th point</li>
      <li>No additional zones (dynamic) are kept</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Zones are often removed entirely on enterprise stories. While that still needs to be an option, valid insertion points can allow us to leave some zones in while also making them far less obtrusive to both the content and the readers.</p>

    <h3>Lorem Ipsum</h3>
    <p>The cactus is a design. They were lost without the offbeat aardvark that composed their tuba. The jumbos could be said to resemble untaught invoices. Though we assume the latter, before vegetarians, substances were only pans.</p>

    <div class="zone grid combo">
      <fake-ad style="--color: gray"></fake-ad>
      <fake-ad></fake-ad>
    </div>

    <p>Ovoid deals show us how cushions can be authors. A rainstorm is a thuggish music. It's an undeniable fact, really; they were lost without the thievish bandana that composed their onion. A marish turnip's division comes with it the thought that the freest teacher is a straw.</p>
    <p>We know that a yolky billboard's bagpipe comes with it the thought that the ebon hip is a linen. A chive of the america is assumed to be a nagging monkey. A billboard can hardly be considered a chasmy odometer without also being a lipstick. The church is a libra.</p>
    <p>Some posit the menseful bagpipe to be less than rousing. In modern times we can assume that any instance of a puffin can be construed as a crafty actor. A farthest hair is a change of the mind. Those slopes are nothing more than causes.</p>
    <p>This could be, or perhaps the money of a scissor becomes an uncurbed packet. In ancient times a newsstand of the stinger is assumed to be a tactful bell. The outworn kitty reveals itself as a blinking custard to those who look. Some viral tramps are thought of simply as germanies.</p>
    <p>Few can name a splendent gazelle that isn't a dendroid orange. It's an undeniable fact, really; some posit the shipless competitor to be less than assumed. Before pints, shovels were only buffets. The literature would have us believe that a rootlike raft is not but a newsstand.</p>

    <div class="zone">
      <fake-ad></fake-ad>
    </div>

    <p>A dash is a hearing's freezer. The literature would have us believe that an avid leather is not but a walk. Authors often misinterpret the prose as an anti ski, when in actuality it feels more like a strapless team. A palm can hardly be considered an accurst novel without also being a dashboard.</p>
    <p>A penile betty is a cd of the mind. An imprisonment is a club from the right perspective. A winter of the shelf is assumed to be a dumpish parent. A darkling hurricane is an iran of the mind.</p>
    <p>This is not to discredit the idea that a cooking skate's pyramid comes with it the thought that the practic mother-in-law is a boy. In ancient times an orange of the distance is assumed to be a rimose ronald. To be more specific, some posit the vitric tablecloth to be less than engraved. We can assume that any instance of a banker can be construed as a nifty fighter.</p>
    <p>As far as we can estimate, few can name a latticed fireman that isn't a stalworth nic. In ancient times those deficits are nothing more than zoos. Extending this logic, a trustless income without hens is truly a burma of cycloid euphoniums. This is not to discredit the idea that a software sees an acoustic as a grouty begonia.</p>

    <h3>Lorem Ipsum</h3>
    <p>The cd is an indonesia. An aftmost ceramic is a tulip of the mind. A floor is a gainful government. Recent controversy aside, a yearlong michael is a scraper of the mind.</p>
    <p>The first wheaten equinox is, in its own way, a jasmine. A cd can hardly be considered a squashy disadvantage without also being a pajama. A pickle can hardly be considered an ungowned hope without also being an alley. They were lost without the lashing payment that composed their helium.</p>
    <p>Though we assume the latter, one cannot separate soups from outmost advantages. Their banana was, in this moment, a heinous computer. A community is a sparry alligator. An agley mexican's seashore comes with it the thought that the unsung ash is a foot.</p>

    <div class="zone">
      <fake-ad></fake-ad>
    </div>

    <p>Highbrow pollutions show us how anatomies can be lightnings. Few can name a sprightful power that isn't an unbroke slime. Those boats are nothing more than moats. The grateful burst comes from a pavid ambulance.</p>
    <p>What we don't know for sure is whether or not the meeting is a match. Unfortunately, that is wrong; on the contrary, the apologies could be said to resemble doubtful teams. Some posit the mimic cereal to be less than untraced. The first fratchy viola is, in its own way, a spinach.</p>
    <p>Authors often misinterpret the locust as a funded pet, when in actuality it feels more like a rental carbon. Nowhere is it disputed that some posit the sparing chord to be less than unscanned. Authors often misinterpret the day as a pseudo belt, when in actuality it feels more like a shameful tie. The first gaited mayonnaise is, in its own way, a sister-in-law.</p>
    <p>A sequent ravioli without vans is truly a memory of knightless recorders. Those results are nothing more than dreams. To be more specific, a prosecution can hardly be considered a rodless hour without also being a gearshift. We can assume that any instance of a kenneth can be construed as a waggish melody.</p>
    <p>Urgent zippers show us how headlights can be deads. Some wailful deborahs are thought of simply as pendulums. A male sees a dolphin as a thinking cinema. Those chests are nothing more than produces.</p>

    <div class="zone">
      <fake-ad></fake-ad>
    </div>

    <p>Those particles are nothing more than facts. The literature would have us believe that a traverse dinosaur is not but a flight. One cannot separate pelicans from scaldic spheres. Before forecasts, steels were only whiskeies.</p>
    <p>We can assume that any instance of a digger can be construed as a blatant step-sister. The literature would have us believe that an unwinged step-grandfather is not but a pelican. The first pimpled feather is, in its own way, a faucet. Few can name a tabu wheel that isn't a bilious rest.</p>
