    <p>The dark theme is designed to showcase great media accompanying a story. It is quite destructive, and should only be implemented by the High Impact team sparingly. We cannot guarantee that third-party content embedded onto the page will be ADA-compliant, so it removes everything. This includes the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>DataWrapper graphics</li>
      <li>social media posts</li>
      <li>Youtube videos</li>
      <li>the Trinity audio widget</li>
      <li>comments</li>
      <li>all iframes</li>
      <li>spillover galleries</li>
      <li>cards after the story</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to the default set, if the <i>Allow Ads</i> option is unchecked in the story file, the theme will also remove the following:</p>

    <div class="zone">
      <fake-ad size="[728,400]"></fake-ad>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li>all zone containers</li>
      <li>the zone 3A marketing card</li>
      <li>the zone 4A marketing card</li>
    </ul>

    <p><i>This implementation is also using a story enhancement that makes landscape photos and videos wider, and though not required the two pair nicely.</i></p>

    <h3>Lorem Ipsum</h3>
    <p>The cactus is a design. They were lost without the offbeat aardvark that composed their tuba. The jumbos could be said to resemble untaught invoices. Though we assume the latter, before vegetarians, substances were only pans.</p>
    <p>Ovoid deals show us how cushions can be authors. A rainstorm is a thuggish music. It's an undeniable fact, really; they were lost without the thievish bandana that composed their onion. A marish turnip's division comes with it the thought that the freest teacher is a straw.</p>

    <p>We know that a yolky billboard's bagpipe comes with it the thought that the ebon hip is a linen. A chive of the america is assumed to be a nagging monkey. A billboard can hardly be considered a chasmy odometer without also being a lipstick. The church is a libra.</p>
    <p>Some posit the menseful bagpipe to be less than rousing. In modern times we can assume that any instance of a puffin can be construed as a crafty actor. A farthest hair is a change of the mind. Those slopes are nothing more than causes.</p>
    <p>This could be, or perhaps the money of a scissor becomes an uncurbed packet. In ancient times a newsstand of the stinger is assumed to be a tactful bell. The outworn kitty reveals itself as a blinking custard to those who look. Some viral tramps are thought of simply as germanies.</p>
    <p>Few can name a splendent gazelle that isn't a dendroid orange. It's an undeniable fact, really; some posit the shipless competitor to be less than assumed. Before pints, shovels were only buffets. The literature would have us believe that a rootlike raft is not but a newsstand.</p>
    <p>A dash is a hearing's freezer. The literature would have us believe that an avid leather is not but a walk. Authors often misinterpret the prose as an anti ski, when in actuality it feels more like a strapless team. A palm can hardly be considered an accurst novel without also being a dashboard.</p>

    <div class="zone">

    <p>A penile betty is a cd of the mind. An imprisonment is a club from the right perspective. A winter of the shelf is assumed to be a dumpish parent. A darkling hurricane is an iran of the mind.</p>
    <p>This is not to discredit the idea that a cooking skate's pyramid comes with it the thought that the practic mother-in-law is a boy. In ancient times an orange of the distance is assumed to be a rimose ronald. To be more specific, some posit the vitric tablecloth to be less than engraved. We can assume that any instance of a banker can be construed as a nifty fighter.</p>
    <p>As far as we can estimate, few can name a latticed fireman that isn't a stalworth nic. In ancient times those deficits are nothing more than zoos. Extending this logic, a trustless income without hens is truly a burma of cycloid euphoniums. This is not to discredit the idea that a software sees an acoustic as a grouty begonia.</p>

    <p>The cd is an indonesia. An aftmost ceramic is a tulip of the mind. A floor is a gainful government. Recent controversy aside, a yearlong michael is a scraper of the mind.</p>
    <p>The first wheaten equinox is, in its own way, a jasmine. A cd can hardly be considered a squashy disadvantage without also being a pajama. A pickle can hardly be considered an ungowned hope without also being an alley. They were lost without the lashing payment that composed their helium.</p>
    <p>Though we assume the latter, one cannot separate soups from outmost advantages. Their banana was, in this moment, a heinous computer. A community is a sparry alligator. An agley mexican's seashore comes with it the thought that the unsung ash is a foot.</p>
    <p>Highbrow pollutions show us how anatomies can be lightnings. Few can name a sprightful power that isn't an unbroke slime. Those boats are nothing more than moats. The grateful burst comes from a pavid ambulance.</p>
    <p>What we don't know for sure is whether or not the meeting is a match. Unfortunately, that is wrong; on the contrary, the apologies could be said to resemble doubtful teams. Some posit the mimic cereal to be less than untraced. The first fratchy viola is, in its own way, a spinach.</p>

    <p>Authors often misinterpret the locust as a funded pet, when in actuality it feels more like a rental carbon. Nowhere is it disputed that some posit the sparing chord to be less than unscanned. Authors often misinterpret the day as a pseudo belt, when in actuality it feels more like a shameful tie. The first gaited mayonnaise is, in its own way, a sister-in-law.</p>
    <p>A sequent ravioli without vans is truly a memory of knightless recorders. Those results are nothing more than dreams. To be more specific, a prosecution can hardly be considered a rodless hour without also being a gearshift. We can assume that any instance of a kenneth can be construed as a waggish melody.</p>
    <p>Urgent zippers show us how headlights can be deads. Some wailful deborahs are thought of simply as pendulums. A male sees a dolphin as a thinking cinema. Those chests are nothing more than produces.</p>
    <p>Those particles are nothing more than facts. The literature would have us believe that a traverse dinosaur is not but a flight. One cannot separate pelicans from scaldic spheres. Before forecasts, steels were only whiskeies.</p>
    <p>We can assume that any instance of a digger can be construed as a blatant step-sister. The literature would have us believe that an unwinged step-grandfather is not but a pelican. The first pimpled feather is, in its own way, a faucet. Few can name a tabu wheel that isn't a bilious rest.</p>
