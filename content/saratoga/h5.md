Default browser spacing for the `<h5>` atom should be used unless specifically set at the molecule or organism level. Doing so reduces bloat, given that this atom is used in a couple different scenarios, and allows for cascading to apply properly at that level.

#### Example
<h5>Jayhawks back in town, start practicing for Saturdayâ€™s Eastern Michigan game</h5>
