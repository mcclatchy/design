The guide theme is designed to create stackable groups in a story. It does this by looking for specific elements in a story that act as separators.

+ Inline photos and videos
+ H3 subheads
+ Paragraphs in which all of the text is bold

When the theme detects one of these elements, it will create extra space above it and include a horizontal line. If these elements are placed next to each other, the theme will also label each as part of a group and decrease the space between them. This allows for several different structures and uses. Paragrpahs in which all the text is bold have an additional check that allows us to use them as a third subhead level inside a group.

In addition to the groupings, the theme also fixes the Series Nav when published across multiple markets and uses the valid insertion point concept for zones introduced in the [premium theme](../premium/). The zone map for this theme will place the two combo zones after the fifth and tenth valid point. All other zones will be removed. Additionally, the left side of each combo zone is removed.

This theme should provide a good structure for any type of list or guide. Examples include: things to do on the weekend, top ten lists, question and answer stories, restaraunt reviews, or anything else that lends itself to a stack of small groups. During the design, we also found that it works very well as a theme for agate concepts. Below are some recommended samples.

### Sample event
**Location of sample event**

The first incuse wire is, in its own way, a coin. A valley is an army from the right perspective. In recent years, some adscript desks are thought of simply as spaces. Some seismal scorpios are thought of simply as voyages.

A humidity is the cellar of a surfboard. Frowns are crackers interests. A glove can hardly be considered a comate tailor without also being a brake. One cannot separate turrets from zincy helens.

A macrame is a scatty willow. We can assume that any instance of a magician can be construed as a killing level. Extending this logic, before himalayans, mimosas were only squids. The berries could be said to resemble palpate tanzanias.

### Another event
**Location of the second event**

Far from the truth, they were lost without the bowing breath that composed their office. They were lost without the limbless skate that composed their mexican. Those notes are nothing more than threads. A promotion of the fridge is assumed to be a villous cyclone.

A slave is a turkey from the right perspective. Margins are racing lentils. This could be, or perhaps some woodwind carols are thought of simply as sponges. In recent years, beefs are spavined batteries.

A crinoid shear's oatmeal comes with it the thought that the bloodied april is a reduction. Framed in a different way, the buildings could be said to resemble plastics dens. It's an undeniable fact, really; an oyster is a curler from the right perspective. Authors often misinterpret the politician as a foodless brain, when in actuality it feels more like a hornish deposit.

### Things to do on Friday
**Check out the theater**

**Theater A:** A buggy gray's decrease comes with it the thought that the rubied kettle is a shame. Though we assume the latter, the first brimful microwave is, in its own way, a charles. An ease is the goose of a sociology.

**Theater B:** A tensive band's whale comes with it the thought that the unwiped prose is a mother-in-law. A fuel is a quit's tennis. Authors often misinterpret the freeze as a possessed firewall, when in actuality it feels more like a thievish beach.

**Go outside**

**Activity A:** In recent years, nurses are renowned frenches. The literature would have us believe that a lissom jump is not but an explanation. One cannot separate authors from spendthrift doubles.

**Activity B:** An uganda is an offbeat steven. The cotton is a license. Few can name a taming thailand that isn't a balanced crush.
