A word of caution before delving deeper. There are four visual elements that are absolutely critical to any successful article: a headline, a media element, text and [inline links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink). All of the elements listed here are intended to supplement those four. They do not work in all of our products, or in a very small percentage of unsupported browsers, so it is essential that the article can stand on its own without them.

To use one of these elements, click the copy code button in Chrome under an example on a detail page and paste it into an embed in CUE. The starter HTML will include text and attributes that reflect the sample, which will need to be adjusted to fit your needs. If you are Chrome-averse, highlight the starter HTML and copy/paste as usual.
