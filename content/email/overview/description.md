The EDS is based upon a base template structure with modules and atoms that are inserted within the framework. Imagine a base template as the framing and walls for a house and the atoms, layouts and modules as the paint, flooring, furniture and decor.

An 8-pixel grid was used in the development of our email design system to facilitate sizing, spacing and establish vertical rhythm. This means that the size of all elements is calculated in multiples of 8, both vertically and horizontally.
