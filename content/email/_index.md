title: "The Email design system"

The McClatchy Email Design System (EDS) exists to provide visual alignment of our emails with the Saratoga Design System (SDS) and is organized with an atomic design structure. This system serves to streamline our email design workflow and provide consistency across all email products.

By creating a base template and utilizing various organisms in a modular fashion, we can quickly and easily generate new complete templates for various needs and be confident that they both look and function the way they should.

This style guide serves as a reference to the rules of the EDS as well as a code library of common elements and layouts.

### Description
The EDS is based upon a base template structure with atomic elements that are inserted within the framework. Imagine a base template as the framing and walls for a house and the atomic elements as the paint, flooring, furniture and decor.

An 8-pixel grid was used in the development of our email design system to facilitate sizing, spacing and establish vertical rhythm. This means that the size of all elements is calculated in multiples of 8, both vertically and horizontally.
