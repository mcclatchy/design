title: "McClatchy Email Design System"

The McClatchy Email Design System (EDS) exists to provide visual alignment of our emails with the Saratoga Design System (SDS) and is organized with an atomic design structure. This system serves to streamline our email design workflow and provide consistency across all email products.

By creating a base template and utilizing various organisms in a modular fashion, we can quickly and easily generate new complete templates for various needs and be confident that they both look and function the way they should.

This style guide serves as a reference to the rules of the EDS as well as a code library of common elements and layouts.
