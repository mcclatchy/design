The McClatchy Email Design System exists to provide visual alignment of our emails with the Saratoga Design System (SDS) and is organized with an atomic design structure. This system serves to streamline our email design workflow and provide consistency across all email products.

The email design system is built on an 8-pixel grid and is coded to adapt to mobile screens. There is a code foundation along with a library of common elements and layouts. This style guide serves as a reference to all of the rules of the system as well as a code library.

### Atomic System

By creating a base template and utilizing various organisms in a modular fashion, we can quickly and easily generate new complete templates for various needs and be confident that they both look and function the way they should. Imagine a base template as the framing and walls for a house and the organisms as the paint, furniture and everything else inside.

An 8-pixel grid was used in the development of our email design system to facilitate sizing, spacing and establish vertical rhythm. This means that the size of all elements is calculated in multiples of 8, both vertically and horizontally.
