`.h4` is used as an alternate for `.h3`, typically for editorial content, such as story headlines. It is identical in size and weight to `.h3` but is serif and not uppercase.

<div class="note">
This class is intended to be assigned to <code>td</code> (or on occasion <code>span</code>) tags. Avoid using tags such as <code>h1</code>, <code>p</code> or <code>div</code>, as these HTML elements render inconsistently across email clients and devices.
</div>
