For text links, use one of the text color modifier classes on `a` tags: `.blue`, `.light-blue` or `.white`. The only exception is in the footer or for fine print, where links are underlined but stay the same color as the surrounding text.

### EXAMPLE
<a href="#" style="color: #31409f;">Text link</a>
