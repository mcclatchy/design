To add text you can simply type it. Markdown will convert it to HTML for you. Below is some examples of headers using Markdown. 

I have not made this panel a story body. My theory was that you are going to have to apply custom styles and I didn't want the positioning of story body elements in SDS to bleed in and you not get what you want when the email goes out. We can change that and I can help look into it once you have some pages. If we need to totally remove SDS from this whole section we can, and if we need to write custom CSS we can. SDS is still setting the typography and such for you, and all cards are available (though I don't think they will help you much).


#### EXAMPLE

<div class="example">
<p class="email-p">testing</p>
</div>

```html
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Knock your socks off</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```
